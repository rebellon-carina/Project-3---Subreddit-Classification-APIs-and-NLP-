1641005303,[pics][update] 5 months. 60 pounds down and finally ONEDERLAND!,"5 months and 3 days on keto and I have finally reached onederland, just in time for 2022! That was my initial goal when I started keto in July and this is the first time in my life I’ve ever achieved any major fitness goal I’ve set for myself. Down a total of 60 pounds, 8 inches from my waist, and 10 inches from my hips! 

For those that want to know, I’m pretty strict about having &lt;20g net carbs, except the past two weeks I’ve been a little lenient and have gone up 50g a few times. But that’s only been the past two weeks to indulge in the holidays just a tiny bit. Otherwise strict &lt;20g carbs, probably not great but I don’t necessarily count my other macros, and ~1200 calories now give or take (started out 1500 and took myself down gradually). My clothes are literally falling off me now. I had to clean out my whole wardrobe. I’m so excited to see what 2022 will hold! I’m about half way to my goal weight, still hoping to lose another 55-65 pounds. 

Here’s to our 2022 goals and crushing them all! KCKO!

1641005980,Daily undesired ketosis,"So, i took great interest in keto about 3 months ago, before then i knew only what people told me so i am fairly new to this, that being said i cant seem to find information that supports my own experience with ketosis. That being a sort of keto cycling that i cant shake, it was my intention, since i had achieved ketosis (after about a week) to switch to a 5/2 cycle and to my bewilderment i cant seem to turn it off despite going almost what one could call overboard with carbs, like between 150 and 350 a day. For some reason i am still going into ketosis early in the day everyday, about 12 hours from when i go to sleep at night, even though i quite literally eat carb loaded foods early in the day and late at night in an effort to stop keto. It has come to my attention that i might be causing some damage to my liver and kidneys, it doesn't feel life threatening though i am in some pain. Has anyone else experienced anything similar?

Summer turned into nearly 6 months, and I've gained all that I've lost and a little extra. I've told myself that starting January 1st I would get back on the wagon and do the right things. I'm pretty scared because it's hard to ignore the temptation, but I'm really hoping I can be successful this time. The biggest challenge will be that my girlfriend and I tested positive for covid in the last few days and I just want to sit on the couch and eat all of the bad things.

1641047066,My 300th day of keto,"[2021 progress](https://imgur.com/a/ZvhAyVP)

I’ve been posting my progress here every 100 days, and I have to admit, I really wanted to be at 100 pounds lost for this one! 46F SW330 CW 234 GW 200. But weight loss isn’t liner and I know I will stick with it and get there!

This past 100 days have been the most interesting for me. One of the big things I’ve learned is that you will do EVERYTHING right and you may still gain weight overnight. Your body will hold onto water or waste for reasons you have no control of (stress! Cycle!). So, although I do weigh myself daily, I don’t get too wound up in the numbers - I just use it as a data point.

I also started with a keto friendly dietician. I was noticing that I was getting weird about food and exercise - like eating 900 calories a day and working out for two hours. That is not smart folks, trust me. My workout regimen is much more sustainable now - I weight lift 5 times a week, ride my bike 4, and use water aerobics to loosen up my joints.

My dietician also got me to wear a constant glucose monitor - and the information I got from wearing that was fascinating. Fatty ice cream? Doesn’t spike my blood sugar. Heavy exercise and stress? Big spikes. Understanding how your body reacts to different foods really helps you adjust to how you pick foods - because I know how the different foods make me feel after eating them - which also makes it easier to say no to the garbage. I have ‘cheated’ but it’s been maybe 3 special desserts over the past 300 days. A couple special Christmas cookies. Chinese food on Christmas eve. But each time, I had a little until I felt like I wasn’t denying myself, and what I did choose to eat was a much smarter choice.

I have had no problem doing keto while feeding my family and being the only one in the house doing it. I make normal dinners and I just don’t eat the starchy sides and rolls. I get the keto ice cream and treats, but not to access. I keep my calories between 1200-1900 (usually at 1600). I barely drink anymore. I have a huge amount of energy. My arthritis is much more under control. I’m wearing XL clothes - 300 days ago I was squeezing into 3x. I had to get a whole new wedding ring because I went down more than 3 sizes.

I assume we will get a bunch of New Years resolution people on this site today. Know that this diet is life changing. I never thought just cutting down carbs and sugar could 1. Make me feel SO MUCH BETTER and 2. Really be this easier. You just need to make sure you are getting your electrolytes (I use Zym tablets and LMNT). I also strongly recommend getting exercise in. Yes, you do lose slower, but you feel good. Also - the more muscle you have the more calories you burn daily.

1641050261,"Not losing weight on a keto diet, The Most Common Reasons for not losing weight on a keto diet."," 

A keto diet is a type of diet that greatly reduces carbohydrate intake. Normally, the body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose sugar, which it uses for energy. When there are not enough carbohydrates in the body, it enters a stage called ketosis.

During ketosis, the body works very well to burn fat and use it instead of glucose for energy. This fat burning makes ketogenic diets a popular choice for people who want to lose weight.

However, some people may find that they do not lose weight on a keto diet. In most cases, this will be because they have not yet entered ketosis.

There are other reasons why a person may not lose weight while following a keto diet. In this article, we present various possibilities.

While I'm in ketosis even trace amounts of soy in food hits me like a truck carrying the flu virus and I'm out of commission for days. 

I've tested it recently since I fell out of keto for Christmas cookies and had soy again with no issues.

Although we have been taught to be scared of fat, the truth is that fat is a friend and a better friend than we could have ever thought of.

Sure we need fat to ensure we’ve got beautiful skin, hair and nails, but it goes beyond that.

You could try eating a few rolls of bread and you wouldn’t make it past that 10 AM hump.

The Ketogenic Diet is designed to pull your body out of the sugar track.

And when you pull out there will be no going back.

You are going to be satiated and feel wonderful focus, additionally, you’re going to feel the type of energy you likely haven’t felt since you were a toddler.

# Ketogenic Diet Outline

### How Carbs Affect Your Weight

***Question: Name me food that tastes “oooh so good” but is bad for you?***

Do donuts come to your mind?

A bag of potato chips?

A greasy slice of pizza?

What about a Snickers bar?

Wherever your food pleasure lies, chances are; that it is steeped in sugary carbs.

According to the USDA, the average American consumes 150-170lb of sugar each year.

Back in the early 1800s, the average American sugar intake was only 4-6lb per year.

Man, how times have changed.

***With all being said, how do carbs affect your bodyweight?***

The answer to that is… Water weight.

You can thank glycogen for this.

Glycogen is a form of glucose stored in the liver and muscle tissues and the primary dietary source of glucose is carbohydrate.

Medical science shows that every 1 gram of glycogen carries 3 to 4 grams of water.

***Research has proven that a high carb intake increases glycogen levels while low-carb intake reduces it.***

So, if you take into account that the average man can store up to 7 grams of glycogen per pound of body weight, that’s enough to make a huge impact on the weight scale, particularly if he consumes a copious amount of carbs.

### Wait, So Body Fat Is Not A Factor?

Yes, body fat is definitely a factor.

In fact, ever since people started consuming more carbs (sugar), the U.S. obesity rates have risen.

The number of U.S. citizens who are categorized as obese has nearly doubled over the past 30 years.

You see the correlation now between body fat and carbs? If not, there is one more piece of information I would like to share.

In addition to being stored in the liver and muscle tissues, glycogen is stored in fat cells.

This is the same glycogen that holds 3 to 4 grams of water.

***By lowering carb intake, you deplete your regular stores of glycogen which shows as weight loss on a scale.***

This is the reason an obese person who follows a low-carb diet will always lose more weight versus a slimmer person; they carry more fat cells (each containing water-holding glycogen).

So if an obese individual decided to follow the ketogenic diet, they are bound to drop a substantial amount of weight.

However, it is much greater than the low carb part of the diet that makes weight loss a reality.

### Keto Helps You Lose Weight

Numerous studies have touted the weight loss benefits of a low-carb diet.

***The keto diet enhances this benefit.***

How so? The low carb intake makes your body produce ketones in the liver to be used as energy (called ketosis), a byproduct of burning body fat.

Reducing carbs allows the body to use glycogen buildup within your fat stores as fuel, resulting in weight loss.

This effect is doubled when you burn glycogen by exercise.

***Let me say this about weight loss….***

When people say they want to lose weight, they typically mean they desire to lose body fat.

However, you could lose weight by losing muscle mass and water weight as well.

Most diets have you losing all three.

In case you didn’t know, losing muscle mass is rarely a good thing.

Unlike high-carb diets, keto burns body fat along with the water weight within it.

When in a state of ketosis, the body begins to utilize fat for fuel.

In addition, the moderate protein intake protects your muscle tissue from being used as fuel (a process called Gluconeogenesis).

***How sweet is that?***

# Health Benefits Of A Keto Diet

Fat is a cleaner fuel for our body to burn and our body burns it more efficiently.

In fact, it is believed the ketones produced when you are in ketosis are super amazing for our brain.

It is believed they increase mitochondria cells.

You may remember from grade 6 science class that mitochondria are the powerhouses of our cells, they are the energy factories.

Additionally, blood sugar levels become balanced, there are no nasty spikes in insulin which can lead to a host of health problems.

Balanced blood sugar also means your brain and body are calm and focused.

You are also satiated on the ketogenic diet so there are no urges to pick up those unhealthy processed foods that wreak havoc on your body.

Overall on a ketogenic diet, you have more energy, you are more focused, you drop all excess weight and will feel better than you have ever felt in your life.

Some other interesting benefits include:

#### 1. Keto Helps Lower Risk Of Developing Chronic Diseases By Improving Cholesterol

What does type-2 diabetes, stroke, and heart disease have in common? All chronic diseases that the keto diet can help prevent.

One study conducted on an obese individual who followed the ketogenic diet for 24 weeks, resulted in a significant risk reduction in chronic diseases by weight loss, decreased levels of triglycerides, LDL cholesterol (the bad cholesterol) and blood glucose, and increased levels of HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol).

Being that heart disease, diabetes, and stroke are three of the leading causes of death in the world, it is phenomenal to have a diet combat them.

Keto eliminates processed, refined carbs that have been linked to several diseases, including obesity, heart disease, and type-II diabetes.

In fact, the development of type-II diabetes is strongly contributed to continuously eating high glycemic foods (e.g., whole grains, bran, germ) that spikes your blood sugars.

Another chronic disease that correlates with those other three is high blood pressure.

#### 2. Keto Lowers Blood Pressure

High blood pressure (HBP) is one of those diseases that gets swept under the rug in terms of how lethal it is for a person’s health.

***That’s why it has been dubbed the “the silent killer.”***

If left untreated, HBP can lead to:

* Stroke
* Heart disease
* Peripheral artery disease
* Erectile dysfunction
* Kidney damage
* Angina
* Fluid in the lungs
* Vision loss
* Memory loss

Be aware that these aren’t symptoms of HBP.

HBP is a symptomless disease for most people except in most rare cases known as hypertensive crisis.

***If you or your family have a history of high blood pressure, following a low-carb diet, may be a godsend.***

Medical researchers tout low-carb diets like keto as an effective method to reduce blood pressure.

If you take high blood pressure medication, please consult with your doctor first before trying this diet out.

One way that people develop high blood pressure is by eating too many refined carbs over a lengthy period of time.

The reason most people consume so many refined carbs is due to how poorly it satisfies their appetite.

#### 3. Keto Prevents Binge Eating

The number one reason most diets fail long-term is that they leave people hungry as heck!

They allow the consumption of low satiety foods such as white potatoes, rice, and bread.

Eating these foods eventually leads people to unfollow their diet and eat every calorie under the sun (aka binge eating).

***That’s not the case with the ketogenic diet.***

Research illustrates that a high protein, low-carb diet reduces hunger and lowers food intake.

In addition, the amount of dietary fat you’ll consume will leave you very satiated.

Another problem with most other diets is that they’re energy zappers.

That’s not the case when you go “keto.”

#### 4. Keto Boosts Energy Levels By Boosting Brain Power

Who doesn’t need more energy in this hustle and bustle world?

***Following a ketogenic diet helps many individuals gain more energy to perform their day to day activities.***

The main reason for this is; ketones replace glucose as the brain’s fueling source.

When carbs are eliminated or minimized, ketones provide up to 70% of the brain’s energy needs; this boosts mental focus and alertness throughout the day.

Another interesting fact is that ketones keep people who go through prolonged periods of starvation (e.g., coma patients) alive.

Then again, it makes sense considering that intermittent fasting works well in conjunction with the keto diet.

# Intermittent Fasting On The Keto Diet

Intermittent fasting maximizes weight loss benefits of the Keto Diet.

The main reason you are reading this article is that you’re interested in losing weight, that’s understandable.

***With that said, using intermittent fasting (IF) along with the keto diet maximizes weight loss.***

IF is a term for an eating pattern that cycles between periods of fasting and eating.

Like the keto diet, several studies have shown IF to be an effective weight-loss method as well as reducing the onset of chronic diseases such as type-II diabetes.

That’s why it makes sense to use IF in conjunction with the ketogenic diet.

**These are the 3 most popular IF methods:**

* **Eat-Stop-Eat:** This involves fasting for 24 hours, once or twice a week.
* **The 16/8 Method:** This method involves skipping breakfast and restricting your daily eating period to 8 hours, for example from 12 pm to 8 pm, afterward, you “fast” for 16 hours in-between.
* **The 5:2 Diet:** On two non-consecutive days of the week, only eat 500-600 calories. You eat normally for the other remaining 5 days.

From these three methods, elements of the 16/8 Method work best with the keto diet.

At the end of this article, you will see a 30-Day Keto Diet Meal Plan with a full collection of recipes.

With this meal plan, you skip breakfast every 3 days, doing this makes you fast longer which helps to:

* Burn more body fat
* Have more energy as you start your day
* Reduce chronic inflammation
* Improve brain function
* Thoroughly cleanse toxins from body cells

Utilizing IF and keto together helps you lose unwanted inches off your waist.

Like a Friday the 13th movie, there are several versions of the keto diet.

Here are the four most popular ones.

# Different Types Of Ketogenic Diets

1. **The targeted ketogenic diet (TKD):** This version is where you can consume carbs around a workout.
2. **The standard ketogenic diet (SKD):** This version focuses on high-fat, moderate protein, low-carb diet. It typically contains 75% fat, 20% protein, and only 5% carbs.
3. **The cyclical ketogenic diet (CKD):** This version involves periods of higher-carb refeeds, such as 5 ketogenic days followed by 2 high carb days.

**High-protein ketogenic diet:** This version is similar to a standard ketogenic diet, but includes more protein. The ratio is often 60% fat, 35% protein, and 5% carbs. While embarking on this keto diet journey, below are the foods that you need to ignore like a spam phone call.

# Foods To Avoid On Keto

* White potatoes
* Alcohol
* Bread, pasta, tortillas, and other foods that contain gluten
* Condiments such as ketchup, soy sauce, and barbecue sauce that contain sugar, artificial ingredients, excessive salt, or gluten
* Corn (including popcorn, cornbread, and popped corn chips)
* Foods that contain high-fructose corn syrup or trans (hydrogenated)fats
* Foods that contain sugar, artificial sweeteners, or soy
* Fruit juice (even 100% fresh!)
* Grain-based foods (e.g., wheat, barley, rye, cereal, oatmeal)
* Jams, jellies, pancake syrup
* High sugar dairy products (e.g., ice cream)
* Salty processed snacks (potato chips, popcorn, pretzels, nacho chips, crackers, popcorn)
* Sugary processed snacks (cakes, cookies, cupcakes, candy)
* Sweetened drinks such fruit punch, lemonade and soda

Now that you know what foods to avoid, here are the foods (along with supplements) that you can embrace.

# Foods To Eat On Keto

Your diet should consist primarily of fats if you are trying to get into ketosis.

Essentially, in the first two weeks, known as the induction phase, no more than 50 grams of your calories should be coming from carbohydrates.

If you are very active, you can increase that carb intake by 20 to 30 grams.

Your protein consumption should also be limited and a good rule of thumb is to allow yourself 1 gram of protein for every 2 pounds of your weight.

There are many super delicious foods you can eat as you make your way into ketosis.

# Tips Before You Start

* You can prepare your weekday lunches and dinners on Sunday.
* An easy way to do this is to cook proteins together in one plan and then divide them up for the separate recipes.
* So for example, if you have Chicken Caesar and a Chicken Curry scheduled in one week, you can cook the chicken in one pan and then use half of it for the salad and mix in the other half with your curry sauce.
* Of course, you can cook things separately but this speeds things up and saves you time.
* If your recipe calls for raw vegetables like lettuce, remember to package them separately from the main dish you will reheat come mealtime.
* You will prepare breakfasts every day but they are all very easy and most of them take no longer than 5 minutes to prepare.
* You can prepare smoothies the night before if you want.
* Remember you will use certain things like butter and oil every week so buy those in bulk.
* If you can’t find a certain vegetable you are welcome to sub with another vegetable that is low in sugars.
* Ensure there are at least 12 hours between your last and first meal, longer if you can hold it.
* This puts your body into a fasting state and helps you burn fat faster.
* Remember to drink at least 8 glasses of water per day.
* An easy way to do this is to fill up a 50 oz bottle of water so you can track your progress throughout the day.
* Try to incorporate a little exercise in your weeks, it can be as simple as going for walks or taking the stairs instead of the elevator.
* Remember a little movement goes a long way!

# Wrapping It All Up

After your first four weeks on the Ketogenic Diet, you have likely seen a massive difference in your weight and overall body function.

Switching gears from a sugar-fuelled body to a fat-fuelled body is amazingly uplifting.

You should have seen a great increase in your mental cognition.

Your energy levels should be through the roof.

And you have to have dropped several sizes.

Remember, the Ketogenic Diet is not so much a diet as a lifestyle.

You can continue to feel as amazing as you do now as long as you follow just a few simple keto rules.

Remember to stay away from unhealthy carbs; stick to unprocessed foods and allow fat to be your friend.

Congratulations on your wonderful journey and welcome to a whole new you!

# Frequently Asked Questions

#### 1. What Is Ketosis?

Ketosis is a natural process the body initiates to help us survive when food intake is low, particularly of carbohydrates.

During this process, we produce ketones, which are produced from the breakdown of fats in the liver.

#### 2. How Long Does It Take To Reach Optimal Ketosis?

Warning: The keto diet takes time for your body to get adjusted to it.

With that said, reaching optimal ketosis could about 3-7 days, depending on your body type, activity levels, and what you’re eating.

However, how strict you’re with your carb intake leads your body to reach ketosis faster.

#### 3. Do I Need To Count Calories?

While calories do matter—especially with weight loss—you don’t really have to count calories while following a keto diet because the protein and fat will keep you satisfied.

#### 4. Can I Drink Alcohol?

Alcohol can be consumed but be cognizant of how much and what type you’re drinking.

Wine, beer, and cocktails all have carbohydrates in them.

While it is best to avoid alcohol altogether, one glass of wine out per week won’t hurt.

#### 5. Can I Eat Too Much Fat?

Technically, yes you can eat too much fat and gain weight.

However, most people will find it difficult to overeat on high fat, high protein and low-carb diets.

To ensure you don’t overeat, there are online keto calculators to help you out in this department.

#### 6. What Foods Should I Eat?

Check out the list of keto-approved foods we mentioned earlier.

In a nutshell, stay away from high-carb foods and condiments.

These foods are:

* Candy
* Chocolate
* Bread
* Pasta
* Rice
* Potato chips
* Tomato sauce
* Salad dressing
* Ketchup
* Barbecue sauce

#### 7. How Can I Track My Carb Intake?

Following the keto diet will naturally have your carb intake low.

However, there are smartphone health apps such as MyFitnessPal that makes it easy to track your carb intake.

#### 8. How Much Weight Will I Lose?

How much weight you lose depends on several factors (e.g., genetics, gender, current health level, etc.).

Of course, exercising and living a more active lifestyle — in conjunction with the keto diet — will help you lose weight faster.

#### 9. What Are The Common Mistakes People Make When Doing The Keto Diet?

The three most common mistakes people make are:

* Consuming too much protein
* Mistaking any low-carb diet for very low-ketogenic dieting
* Not allowing for a long enough adaptation period

#### 10. What Are The Potential Dangers And Side Effects Of Keto &amp; How To Cure Them?

When your body is suddenly exposed to a new way of eating, side effects are a likely occurrence.

With that said, the keto diet does have its side effects but they are all curable.

#### Side Effect &amp; How To Cure Them:

* **Headaches:** Drink water with salt sprinkled in it.
* **Feeling tired and cranky:** Eat more fat.
* **Leg cramps:** Drink water with salt &amp; supplement with magnesium.
* **Constipation:** Drink more water, add extra salt to foods&amp; eat more high fiber, non-starchy vegetables.
* **Bad breath:** Brush your teeth and tongue more often. Eat a few more carbs if the smell becomes a long-term issue.
* **Reduced exercise performance:** Drink plenty of water with salt prior to exercising. Be patient because it will take time for your body to adjust from being a sugar-burner to burning primarily fat for energy, even in the muscles.",True,1,1.0,4,GaylordTurner,False,False,keto

1641063126,Today is a big day!,"Namaste,

I love this group and the support you guys give. I am new to KETO. In regards to workouts, I just do a lot of walking, meditation, and yoga. I am at 188lbs with a 29.41 BMI. I gained weight since coming back to India in 2019 owing to the pandemic to take care of my parents. I am trying to achieve between 140-150lbs. At the moment I cannot go to the gym. I also avoid some necessary ingredients like avocado as they are expensive. Another issue is that my parents do not cook any meat, and I do not prefer eating out so it's going to be a vegetarian KETO plan for me, for now :)

So, I started to test the diet for 10 days and then chalked out this simple vegetarian plan for me, which I started today :P \[wish me luck and loss(in pounds lol)\]

But one thing....never give up. I never did, never do. The main reason for my weight was a stressful episode in my life since the end of 2019, which was a huge blow. In short, the people I trusted backstabbed by stealing millions off my business, making me broke and homeless in my city NY. Made me rich to a rag haha. But it took some time to gather myself and now the FIRST priority ""after slowly standing on my feet"", was to stand on the body and mind that I love. I know I will achieve it, it is integral. But I also want to tell you that reading your encouragements helps. I may be one of the silent visitors but I do read here, and it helps me tremendously. So a huge thank you to ALL for that.

I wish you all a wonderful and eventful New Year. Your wish WILL come true, you need to PURSUE, HUSTLE.

1641080258,"""fats make you fuller"". Apparently not?","I was just watching one of my nutrition lectures, and I learned that for us to feel the sensation of being full and getting that 'satisfaction' after eating, leptin must be secreted for it to go to the hypothalamus and bind to the LEP-R receptors. Our body only then recognises this as 'yep that's enough food. We're good.'

I also learned that insulin stimulates both the synthesis and secretion of leptin. This has the following implication: we need a rise in blood sugar, so that insulin can get released -&gt; secrete a fair amount of leptin -&gt; feel full. On this idea, my lecturer said that ""fats making us fuller"" comes across as a misunderstanding for the most part. Whilst it could keep you full ***after*** you feel the initial 'fullness', but to *actually feel full in the first place,* fats are actually counteractive. This is because fats slow the digestion rate of both proteins and carbs (ie. agents who are capable of spiking blood sugar) and delays insulin secretion, and therefore leptin secretion as well.

And this led onto an important point for those following LCHF/keto approach; for those who don't track their calories and only just 'listen to their body', having such high intake of fat + very limited rise in blood sugar levels, they could actually PUT ON WEIGHT because they have harder time feeling full after they eat!

This was the main takeaway from the lecture though. Any ideas/counterarguments/supporting arguments?

I (27F) am a former ketoer. Did my first round this time last year and managed to lose about 5kgs in the first month. My skin cleared up like crazy and I felt mentally amazing and clear, and I just felt right, for lack of a better phrase. I was on and off keto during the Covid lockdowns and never really picked it up after March 2021. I gained the weight back and now sit comfortably (uncomfortably) at 80kgs. In Sept 2021 I was diagnosed with an underfunctioning gallbladder and an ejection rate of 11% (anything under 38% is deemed as underfunctioning). My specialist has recommended I get my gallbladder out which is likely to be scheduled in the next few months. 

My question is, is it safe to start up on keto again with an underfunctioning gallbladder, and subsequently no gallbladder? I have tried bringing this up with both my specialist and my GP who both just completely disregarded keto altogether and wouldnt recommend it to even completely healthy people. I feel a bit lost as the medical advice I have been given doesn't seem to be individualized to me and my current health concerns, and just seems to be based on their existing medical beliefs. 

If anyone who has had a similar experience could give some advice, it would be hugely appreciated!

1641119953,Long-term ketosis and the body's desire to restart.,"Long story short, after nearly 2 years of keto (6 months of strictly staying under 20g net carbs without a single cheat meal) I had planned a break for the holidays, as I had began losing the benefits of keto due to getting used to it. If anyone says keto is unsustainable, they're wrong. My body loves it and doesn't need carbs in order to function. Due to being used to not consuming carbs for such a long time, my best guess is that my body had supposedly began considering ketosis the optimal state.

Originally, the break was supposed to be only for the 2 days of Christmas, however my family didn't like the bones they were seeing on me as I was clearly underweight, so they kept pushing me to eat every day, including the time between Christmas and New Years. Now that this is over, I am finally restarting keto.

Unsurprisingly, I had gained a lot during this break and my body clearly didn't like it. I was bloated like a balloon, aching all over and my mind was on another planet during this hell of a break. I hated carby food and only felt alright while eating meat. On New Year's, as soon as the clock hit 00:00, I put down my drink, pushed away my plate, swapped the mead for whiskey, coke zero and water, and began a liquid fast.

20+ hours in, I felt a familiar sensation that an experienced ketoer would immediately recognise. Strange, usually the body enters ketosis after no less than a full day, a few days or even weeks. It was as if my body couldn't wait to enter ketosis again and rushed things so that it would reach its preferred metabolic state. Unfortunately, my grandmother called for a late after-New-Years dinner and I broke my fast.

No biggie, I'm currently on my 15 hour fast mark (thinking of going for 72 hours) and have occupied the toilet, flushing down as much water as possible and I'm sweating excessively. I don't want to eat anything, the emptiness feels amazing, yet my mouth feels weird. Everyone says listen to your body and what it needs, and my body couldn't have made it clearer that it wants ketosis back. No, it *needs* it. 

Am I getting this wrong or is it truly possible that the body may get used to ketosis in such a way that it would do anything it can to reach it again, as quickly as possible, even after a week-long break?",True,1,1.0,0,bambi_exe,False,False,keto

I am defo producing ketones, I am not over eating (1500-1800 cal), I do tend to eat protein with each meal so maybe that’s a problem. Besides lack of weight loss I feel a lot of the benefits of keto diet. 

Last time I did keto after baby 1, the weight melted off, with minimal effort. So I’m stumped why that’s not the case this time. 

Has anyone experienced this? What would you advice I do to help with weight loss? Why might this be happening? Thanks in advance.",True,1,1.0,1,ismololo,False,False,keto
1641138030,Exploding Head Syndrome and Carbs?,"Hi all! I have been on the keto diet now for 6 months and have seen very positive results. I started the diet to lose a bit of fat around my stomach region, with great results, even though I was still in the normal weight range for my height. I also found that it has greatly improved the symptoms of my bipolar disorder and I have had a stable mood and increased concentration since starting it.

One thing I have found is when I eat carbs (still very few, but I might eat around 30-40 grams in a day) is that I get a mild case of exploding head syndrome. It hasn't bothered me as it has been very occasional. This, however, changed yesterday when I ate well in excess of 200 grams of carbs in a day due to it being the only food avaliable. It was the first time in 6 months that I ate that many carbs and I experienced a hypomanic state that night (not too important to the story, but annacdotal evidence that carbs may make me manic). Also that night I had the most extreme and pervasive experience of exploding head syndrome I have ever had. Every time it occurred I woke up, and as I fell asleep again it almost instantly returned.

I'm hoping this doesn't happen tonight, but I am wondering if anyone else has had this experience and if carbs could be the culprit? Also, if anyone has some information on mental health, could a manic episode increase the likelihood of developing transient exploding head syndrome?

1641162192,"Oroweat Keto Bread experience: didn't spike my blood sugar, toasted up nicely, not sure I'd want it untoasted, not sure it's worth 3 carbs per slice","Most of my success on keto has been with non-processed foots, in part because the pandemic kept me out of stores, but also it seemed I stalled when eating too much processed foods like breads, or various keto treats. And the processed foods are often damn expensive.

I'm older, sort of healthy (bmi 24), and sort of not (various health issues), but I'm not diabetic and my blood sugar levels have never been a problem.

But I bought a glucose meter so that I could test what various keto processed foods would do to me.

So these are my results, I'm not a doctor, I'm not your lawyer, I'm not your architect. YMMV

I purchased a loaf of Oroweat Keto Bread because a) my local Safeway stocked it, and b) they used to be the medium sized local bakery so nostalgia. And their wheat breads were always pretty good. You can find details here: https://sureketo.com/is-it-keto/oroweat-keto-bread

Following the protocol that Steve from Serious Keto seems to use...

This morning about a half hour after I got up, I measured my glucose levels, then I ate one slice of toasted Oroweat Keto Bread with a tablespoon of butter. That was all I ate for the next 2 hours.

The bread is 60 calories per slice, 3g net carbs, 4g protein, 2g fat, and 8g fiber (11 carbs total)

I measured my glucose levels one half hour after my last swallow, and then two hours after eating the bread.

My blood glucose measurements were:

+ 92 mg/dL before eating
+ 103 mg/dL 30 minutes after eating
+ 97 mg/dL 90 minutes after eating.

So for me at least, one slice of this bread has little effect on my blood glucose levels.

I tore off a small piece before toasting and can't really describe it well, it was a bread, not the sort I'd ever really use; I usually would get a sourdoughs, rye, wheat sourdough, or some sort of multiwheat seeded bread.

The slice itself toasted nicely, it hung together whereas other keto breads I've tried like Artisan I bought at Costco become too crumbly and fall apart. It tasted okay toasted with a good texture, but let's face it, mostly I was tasting yummy melted butter.

So all that said, I can see eating this once or twice a week alongside my eggs, or toasting it for a nice MLT, but I'm not sure I would eat it often, I'm think the 3g carbs or 6g with two slices would eat away a bit too much at my 20 carbs.

Though I am appreciative of the 8g of fiber... That's 27% of the recommended 30 g per day.

Please give me your thoughts on my protocol, any problems you see, and how I could make it better.
I would like to find a reliable, easy, relatively inexpensive way to test and experiment various processed foods.

Though reddit doesn't do hashtags, reddit also doesn't do search very well, so I am going to see if this pseudo hashtag lets me find this and perhaps other measurements I take later on.

1641192502,[NSV] 5k Walk Pace Less Than 11'/km,"Hello Internet!

In a previous status post one of the goals I established was to walk a 5k with a sub 11'/km pace.  This morning when I took my walk which is nominally 5k in distance I was trucking along at a good pace.  When I hit my first km my time was 11'01"".  At that point I figured I could pull it off.  So I resolved to go sub 11 minutes for 5km and I did it.  

\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/Nj6bTS4.png](https://i.imgur.com/Nj6bTS4.png))

I feel like I had some help, though.  We had a pretty nice cold front come through, so the temperature was about 34 degrees and the wind chill of around 24 degrees (yes, degrees F.  In C that's around 1/-4).  This had the effect of keeping my HR down (less need for radiative cooling) and allowed me to exert a little bit longer.  I am in Houston, so moving like 4 feet outside on a normal non winter day is about 4 gallons of sweat.  Anyways, I am still going to take it.  Goal set and checked.

It is a nice NSV because when I decided to start walking back in October my pace was about 13'15""/km.  So this is evidence of enhanced cardiovascular performance attributed to weight loss and exercise adaptation.  I really enjoy tangible results like this since they are boost to confidence and real evidence of change.  So I thought I would share.

I’ve been overweight for at least that long and was getting concerned since I was going to the bathroom a lot during work. I finally made an appt with a PCP and gynecologist. My PCP doctor told me that my A1C level was 6.4 and I should consider a high protein, low carb diet. He was very encouraging and kind. I went to see a gynecologist and a couple weeks later and at the end of the appt, he said a 6.4 was one of the highest A1C level he had seen in his 30+ years and was not very nice :( I went home feeling distraught and embarrassed.

I started keto on Wednesday and I’m worried that I’m eating too much protein. Here’s what I’ve been eating:

Breakfast: 3 eggs and 4 pieces of sausage, or 3 eggs 3 pieces of sausage and 3 pieces of bacon

Lunch: taco salad - ground meat, taco mix, shredded cheese, onions, sour cream, and lettuce 

Dinner: kielbasa and broccoli with shredded cheese 

I’ve been having the same thing for breakfast each day, but other foods I’ve tried for lunch/dinner are turkey and hummus roll ups, buffalo chicken dip with celery sticks, lettuce wrap burger, and chili dogs with no beans.

Easy go to's make my own crackers with eggs cheese and almond flour baked and saved in air tight container. Goes great with any wild caught canned fish macarel, Salmon. Tuna, sardines. Keep my fish intake @ 4 times a week. 

I have frozen slider patties from pastured ground chicken or grass fed beef; seasoned ready to go. Sliders thawed in fridge cook up in minutes. Same with any frozen fish. TIP fresh is not really fresh unless you live by the ocean. 

Kale chocolate (vegan protein) smoothies are like 1 net carbs (chocolate Protein powder no whey but hemp and pea protein which is a comple protein)  +/- what you add to to it. Always add chia for the fiber and extra ALAs. 

Ice cream!! Yes lately almost every night and 100% keto.

In reality has a touch of both but their nutritional chart is correct for serving 1 cup not 1 tsp; food industry cheats a lot this way.

Obviously eggs/avacodo and the Primal kitchen Sauces and Dressings are the best. Always have Cauliflower rice or shread your own in the freezer or fridge. That is your base staple; makes the best fried rice rich in veggies and add any ground meat. 

I have tons more ez 5 min meals.

Macadamian nut oils; my only go to butter.

Breakfast every morning is match green tea with tsp of other benefical herbs filled by coffee grinder full fat cream and Tbs ghee; alternate between cow ghee, Yak (yes Yak 😀), goat ghee or MCT OIL.  Kick every morning with ketones and only eat lunch dinner when hungry; sometimes with Bigger late lunch its straight to light dinner and desert. 

I'm 41 lost 75 pounds from 220 to 145 stable. I eat a lot for maintenance and growing muscle - body composition. For me this is not a quick fix keto but long run.

So my migraines started about a year and a half ago, I woke up with a horrible pain on the right side of my head. Nothing like I had ever experienced before. So in the following 6 months I went to see doctors, did scans, did my own research etc.

Physically, everything was good. I did have a slightly raised blood pressure, but my doctors said it was normal for my weight. So I figured it must be stress and anxiety induced. The migraines did become lighter over time and I kinda got used to them. Over the past year I've done a lot of self-improvement when it comes to mental health and that helped. Also I found that caffeine can help a little if consumed at the right time, as well as avoiding triggers (light, sound, annoying motherfuckers) and massaging my head.

But nothing that would completely eliminate them. I still had migraines almost every day. Until about a couple of weeks ago, when I started keto. First, the migraines became even lighter and shorter but after a few days, they were totally gone. I haven't made other changes in my lifestyle besides keto, so I'm sure that's it. 

I haven't taken measurements of my blood pressure or sugar levels, but from what I gather, that could have been the reason after all. Which still leaves some unanswered questions, but fuck it...

Basically a while back I started keto weighing 322 lbs and was able to get myself down to 238 lbs. However for about the last year or so I have had a hard time getting back into it. I have done a good job of sticking to a keto/low carb diet diet during the week days(except for around thanksgiving and Christmas), usually Monday through either Thursday or Friday, but I have little self control on the weekends. I haven’t gained much weight back, I have done a good job of maintaining. Since I fell off the wagon I have been hovering between the 238 lb and 250 lb mark.

Any tips for how to avoid carb temptations to help me get back to keto full time and not just during the week?

Thus there was no outside pressure to go eat out or go out and drink with friends.

Sodium: I have pink Himalayan salt

Potassium: No Salt Original 

Magnesium: Epsom Salts (Food Grade) called Magnesium sulphate

These are correct, right?

Also one last, which might be a dumb question..... 

Do I need read the serving size instead of weighing 5g, 1g and 300mg?

For salt its showing 5000mg of sodium is actually 3tsp (\~12g)

For Potassium its showing 1/2 tsp (2g)

For Magnesium (Epsom Salts) I can't actually find the serving size, the container just mentions 1tsp (4g) per day... and on the other side says the NRV of 400mg..... so is it safe to assume that 1tsp = 400mg?

Now, presuming I have the Keto rash, which is an allergic reaction, that this two things are connected. I did a quick search hero on r/keto and saw that there are quite a few posts about elevated eosinophils and food allergies. Now, I've never in my life had such problems nor did I had food allergies.

THAT'S GREAT!  WELCOME!

First and foremost if you haven't yet please read the FAQ and then read it again.  It will answer most of your questions.

This is a post about what keto is and what keto is not.  Is pure cane sugar keto? Yes.  Is bacon keto?  Also yes.

Allow me to explain

A ketogenic diet is any diet that puts you into ketosis.  That could be fasting, that could be eating sticks of butter.  To achieve ketosis all you need to do is restrict carbs enough.  A teaspoon of pure cane sugar is 5g of carbs.  Generally people eat 20g of net carbs per day and if your life is made slightly better by putting a spoonful of real sugar in your coffee instead of a substitute and this is not derailing your progress then don't let me stop you.

Also understand that ketosis is not guaranteed fat loss.  While people in ketosis tend to lose weight you can absolutely still eat too much on keto and stall or even gain fat.  I've done it and I have an absolutely spectacular recipe for keto cheesecake that I'll share if you ask nicely enough and want to see that I'm completely correct.

Ketosis is a TOOL not an end goal unless you are trying to treat some other condition besides obesity and diabetes.  Epileptics, dementia patients, people suffering from gut disorders, and others may find it better to remain in  a state of deep ketosis but that's not what this post is about.

A lot of people will take blood measures or pee on sticks to measure ketone levels.  While it's nice to see fancy numbers and changing colors ask yourself this: why on earth do you care if you are making progress toward your goals?

Imagine you lost 10 pounds in the last 4 weeks.  You feel good, you wake feeling rested, your pants fit better.  You pee on a magic stick.  It says you are not in ketosis.  Did you fail?  Nope!  Whatever you are doing is working for you so by all means keep going!  If things change and progress stops for long periods of time then you should stop and reassess.

You got this and this is a great community that is here to answer your questions.  Good luck, KCKO",True,1,1.0,0,stupidrobots,False,False,keto

1641321738,NSV - I can ski again!,"One year of keto today! Down 83 pounds from 296 to 213. I had a recent non-scale victory that has had me jazzed for a few days. Last year right before starting keto one of the straws that broke the camels back and made me decide to do something about my health was a ski trip. I grew up skiing as a family activity going most weekends all of growing up. I did a little bit of racing and skier cross in high school. Since then with grad school, kids, and adulting i had only gone once every few years. I set a day to go with my brother in law and sister in law and was looking forward to it for months. When I got up on the mountain I couldn't believe how hard it was for me. My quads were burning after a single blue square difficulty rated run. Next we did a black diamond (experts only) run. This used to be easy for me. There was several inches of powder on top of a hard crust and then like 18 inches of powder under the crust. Everyone else zipped down the run on top of the crust; however, me being almost 300 lbs I had several instances of a single foot breaking through the crust causing that leg to drop out from under me into the powder below and several times causing the ski to pop off and causing me to fall. I tweaked my back and my knee and was super embarrassed making them wait on me a ton. I called it a day before I really hurt myself at like 10 AM. I was super mad and sad and just frustrated, like really??? I'm too fat to ski??? I used to be good at this. So I channeled that energy into keto and lost 70 pounds in 6 months ish then another 13 in the last 6 months with very little effort. I just got to go skiing with my brother in law again. There was over a foot of fresh powder and I was hesitant about my ability to last the whole day and do hard runs in deep snow even with the weight loss. I didn't want to over set my expectations and be disappointed. I basically planned to do 2-3 runs then take a break and repeat a few times throughout the day. Well I blew my expectations out of the water. I skied all day with a 30 min lunch. I did a double black diamond 5 times in a row with knee to mid thigh deep powder in the thick trees and handled it like a pro. I am beyond elated that I can aain participate in one of my hobbies that my previous weight had taken from me. You too can get back to your old life with keto! KCKO.

1641327252,Is it possible to eat low carb and low calorie?,"I've done keto and Atkins without much luck and I know it's because I'm still simply consuming too many calories, and as much as I want to adhere to a calorie deficit (between 1000-1100 is ideal, less if possible), I find that it's practically impossible.

It seems that there are very very few low carb *and* low calorie foods, from what I've found on my own because generally speaking, it appears that if a food is low carb, it is not low calorie (nuts, some meats, butter, cheese, mayo, oil), and if it's low calorie, then it's not low carb (fruits, some vegetables, some dairy, oatmeal).

The only foods I've found that seem to fit in both categories are seafood, lettuce, spinach and eggs. That's great for some meals, but I feel like in order to adhere to my desired deficit and limit my carb intake at the same time, I have to find some kind of unicorn diet plan and then eat nothing but that exact set of foods every single day and that sounds awful because I like eating a broad variety of foods.

So how do you go about eating keto/low carb and eating at a deficit without being hungry all day long? I'm not sure what to do. I try to limit my carbs and I seem to do fine with that aspect, but I wind up eating 1300-1700 calories a day.

Around the middle though I began to experience pretty traumatic levels of hair loss, and had to have my partner take dozens of pieces of hair off of my back every time I showered.

I have PCOS and so hair loss is already a touchy subject for me, and my hair is already thinner than I'd like it to be because of it. So when my hair started falling out, I really struggled mentally and it is one of the main reasons why I stopped doing Keto.

My keto diet was arguably not the healthiest; I often ate fairly low calorie and had a lot of diet desserts that took up a lot of my net carb intake. I took electrolytes in the beginning to avoid keto flu but stopped a few weeks in and didn't feel any physically different. 

I'm aware now that I need to have a more balanced diet on keto and have to keep up my calorie intake and as well as my protein, and I know how helpful keto is for my PCOS, but I am so mentally traumatized by that hair loss that I'm avoiding going back to it even though I know in the long run its helpful.

I tried to show her the light, but she's back on pizza and ice cream... I'm sure that's going to be great for her blood pressure.

1641399699,Really difficult morning with cravings,"Started on Monday. This is my third day. This morning I’ve been having a difficult time with cravings. I really, really want dennys for breakfast LOL. 

I’m cutting out carbs and sugar for at least a month and then gonna see how I feel at the start of next month but it’s hard because prior to this week I used to live a high carb , low protein diet which is why I look like a horribly skinny-fat person. 

It’s also hard because I found out my favourite roasted milk tea brand I have an unopened box of has 20g of carbs and 11g of sugar!!!!! I’m trying to drink green tea with roasted rice instead because it only has 1g of carbs and no calories. 

I’ve had headaches the past few days. Been trying to drink lots of water, water with lime juice, and salt all my food. Living in Canada is kinda tough because there isn’t that much keto stuff, especially all the brands you guys talk about on here we can’t get like any of them. 

Today I’m going to the store to buy some cooked bbq chicken, which I’ll make into broth in a couple days. Also going to try pork rinds although the only brand they carry is baken ets original. 

They carry keto-type snacks to replace cookies and that but they are extremely expensive, but I want to try one so I’m just gonna get one small thing. 

I really just want to try and get through this first week I know I will feel better if I keep going. It’s tough. My sister also wants to get dinner on Saturday. Hopefully we get sushi and I’ll just eat sashimi lol.",True,1,1.0,0,I_am_the_ent,False,False,keto

Almost everyone knows someone who has used a low carb diet. They have used it themselves had a friend use it or are getting ready to use it . Are these diets magic? Are they safe? Can I really eat all of the cheese and meat I want ? Will I die if I go into ketosis?

These are just a few common questions I hear in regards to questions that concern low carb diets. In this series of articles I will present readers with scientific facts and my practical observations for implications concerning low carb diets. Some low carb supporters will not like what I will have to say. Some low carb haters will not like what I have to say. The objective of these articles are to educate readers on the practical implications of low carb dieting. Some will be offended and some will say how can that be. Either way sit back and enjoy as I attempt to shed light on the highly talked about topic - low carb diets (ketogenic diets)

I have provided a brief overview of some the topics that will be discussed in this series of articles.

What type of changes occur while using low carb diets

Do low carb diets make me mean

Do low carb diets spare muscle

Can I gain weight on a low carb diet

How much weight can I expect to lose

Can this diet help my medical condition

Different types of low carb diets

Why you need to cycle higher days of carbs

Who needs low carb diets

Are they safe for children

Are they beneficial for athletes

The topics mentioned above are just a few that will be addressed in Low Carb Dieting.

Before we move any further let me introduce the word ketogenic. Must of you reading this article are probably familiar with the world as it implies low carb or restriction of carb intake. Simply put for our purposes the words ketogenic and low carb are synonymous. A couple of other comments I would like to make before we move on. This comment is for Low Carb supporters that swear of all vegetables and fruits. Get on medline.com and do some research. Go to the library and look through some journals. A complete diet for long term use needs to incorporate greens and some fruits to be healthy. A short term diet devoid of fruits and vegetables might not be that bad, but rejecting greens and any fruits for life is a bad idea.

This comment is for the low carb haters. One of the number one reasons most of America is fat is because of chronically high insulin levels. Which is primarily contributed to excessive carb intake. Don't get me wrong I am not blaming high carbohydrate intake on all of our obesity problems. I should probably say excessive and the wrong types of carbohydrate at the wrong times are the problem. At the same time the answer is not to eat all of the saturated fat we can find : which can contribute to insulin insensitivity, elevated TG's, increased lipogenesis and digestive problems.

What is a ketogenic diet? A diet that causes ketone bodies to be produced by the liver, and shifts the body's metabolism away from glucose in favor of fat burning. A ketogenic diet restricts carbohydrates below a certain level (generally 100 per day). The ultimate determinant of whether a diet is ketogenic or not is the presence or absence of carbohydrate. Protein and fat intake vary. Contrary to poplar belief eating fat is not what causes ketosis. In the past starvation diets were used often to induce ketosis. I will repeat myself again and say lack of carbohydrate or presence of ultimately determines if the diet is ketogenic.

In most eating plans the body runs on a mixture of protein, fats and carbohydrates. When carbohydrates are severely restricted and glycogen storage (glucose in muscle and liver) is depleted the body begins to utilize other means to provide energy. FFA (free fatty acids) can be used to provide energy, but the brain and nervous system are unable to use FFA's. Although the brain can use ketone bodies for energy.

Ketone bodies are by products of incomplete FFA breakdown in the liver. Once they begin to accumulate fast and reach a certain level they are released , accumulated in the bloodstream and cause a state called ketosis. As this occurs there is a decrease in glucose production and utilization. There is also less reliance on protein to meet energy requirements by the body. Ketogenic diets are often referred to as protein sparing as they help to spare LBM whiled dropping body fat.

In regards to ketogenic diets there are two primary hormones- insulin, glucagon that need to be considered. Insulin can be described as a storage hormone as it's job is to take nutrients out of the bloodstream and carry them to target tissues. Insulin carries glucose from the blood to the liver and muscles, and it carries FFA from the blood into adipose tissue (stored fat triglyceride). On the other hand glucagon breaks down glycogen stores (especially in the liver) and releases them into the blood.

When carbs are restricted or removed insulin levels drop while glucagon levels rise. This causes enhanced FFA release from fat cells, and increased FFA burning in the liver. This accelerated burning of FFA in the liver is what leads to ketosis. There are a number of other hormones involved with this process as well.

In general we refer to three different types of ketogenic diets.  
1) STANDARD KETOGENIC DIET- A diet containing l00 or less grams of carbohydrates is referred to as STANDARD KETOGENIC DIET

2)TARGETED KETOGENIC DIET- consuming carbohydrates around exercise, to sustain performance without affecting ketosis.

3)CYCLICAL KETOGENIC DIET- alternates periods of ketogenic dieting with periods of high carbohydrate intake

The Beginning of Ketogenic diets  
Originally ketogenic diets were used to treat obesity and epilepsy. In general ketogenic diets are similar to starvation diets in the responses that occur in the body. More specifically these two states can be referred to as starvation ketosis and dietary ketosis. These similarities have led to the development of modern day ketogenic diets.

Ketogenic dieting has been used for years in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In the early 1900's times of total fasting was used to treat seizures. This caused numerous health problems and could not be sustained indefinitely.

Due to the impracticalities and health problems occurring with starvation ketogenic diets researchers began to look for a way to mimic starvation ketosis while consuming food. They determined that a diet consisting of high fat, low carb and minimal protein could sustain growth and maintain ketosis for a long period of time. This led to the birth of the original ketogenic diet in 1921 by Dr. Wilder. Dr Wilder's diet controlled pediatric epilepsy in many cases where drugs and other treatments failed.

New epilepsy drugs were invented during the 30's, 40's and 50's and ketogenic diets fell to the wayside. These new drugs lead to almost disappearance of ketogenic diets during this time. A few modified ketogenic diets were tried during this time such as the MCT (medium chain triglycerides) diets, but they were not welly accepted.

In 1994 the ketogenic diet as a treatment for epilepsy was re-discovered. This came about in the story of Charlie a 2yr old with seizures that could not be controlled with mediacions or other treatment including brain surgery. Charlie's father had found reference to the diet through his research and ended up at John Hopkins medical center.

Charlie's seizures were completely controlled as long as he was on the diet. The huge success of the diet prompted Charlie's father to start the Charlie foundation. The foundation has produced several videos, and published the book The Epilepsy Diet Treatment: An Introduction to the Ketogenic diet. The foundation has sponsored conferences to train physicians and dietians to implement the diet. The exact mechanisms of how the ketogenic diet works to control epilepsy are still unknown, the diet continues to gain acceptance as an alternative to drug therapy.

Obesity  
Ketogenic diets have been used for at least a century for weight loss. Complete starvation was studied often including the research of Hill, who fasted a subject for 60 days to examine the effects. The effects of starvation were very successful in regards to treatment of the morbidly obese as rapid weight loss occurred. Other characteristics attributed to ketosis, such as appetite suppression and sense of well being, made fasting even more attractive for weight loss. Extremely obese patients have been fasted for up to one year and given nothing but vitamins and minerals.

The major problem with complete starvation diets is the loss of body protein, primarily from muscle tissue. Protein losses decrease as starvation contines, but up to one half of the total weight loss can be contributed to muscle and water loss.

In the early 1970's Protein Sparing Modified Fasts were introduced. These diets  
allowed the benefits of ketosis to continue while preventing losses of bodily proteins.  
They are still used today under medical supervision

In the early 70's Dr. Atkins introduced Dr. Atkins Diet Revolution With millions of  
copies Sold the diet generated a great deal of interest. Dr. Atkins suggested a diet limited  
in carbohydrate but unlimited in protein and fat. He promoted the diet as it would allow  
rapid weight loss, no hunger and unlimited amounts of protein and fat. He offered just  
enough research to allow the diet recognition. Although most of the evidence

supporting the diet was questionable.

During the 1980's Michael Zumpano and Dan Duchaine introduced two of the earliest  
CKD's THE REBOUND DIET for muscle gain and then the modified version called  
THE ULTIMATE DIET for fat loss. Neither diet became very popular. This was likely  
due to the difficulty of the diet and the taboo of eating high fat.

In the early 90's Dr. Dipasquale introduced the ANABOLIC DIET . This diet promoted 5  
days of high- fat-high protein-low carb consumption whle eating high carbs and virtually  
anything you wanted for two days. The diet was proposed to induce a metabolic shift  
within the five days of eating low carbs (30 or less). The metabolic shift occurred as your  
body switched from being a sugar buring machine to a fat-burning machine.

A few years later Dan Duchaine released the book UNDERGROUND BODYOPUS: MILITIANT WEIGHT LOSS AND RECOMPOSITION . The book included his CKD diet which he called BODYOPUS. The diet was more specified than the Anabolic Diet and gave exercise recommendations as well as the basics concerning exercise physiology. Most bodybuilders found the diet very hard to follow. The carb load phase required eating every 2 hrs and certain foods were prescribed. I personally loved the book, but felt the difficulty of the diet made it less popular. In this author's opinion Ducahine's book is a must read for anyone interested in Nutrition.

Ketogenic Diets have been used for years to treat specific conditions such as obesity and childhodd epilepsy. The effects of these diets have proven beneficial in a number of these well documented cases, but for some reason when we mention any type of low carb diet (ketogenic diet) people begin to tell us about how their doctor or friend told them it would kill them or how that diet was shown to damage the liver or kidneys. Keep in mind epileptic children have been in ketosis for up to three years and shown no negative effects; quiet the opposite. The weight loss in morbidly obese patients has been tremendous and the health benefits numerous. Maybe before coming to the conclusion that all types of ketogenic diets are bad other factors need to be considered such as activity levels, type of ketogenic diet, length of ketogenic diet, past eating experience, purpose of ketogeninc diet, individual body type and response to various eating plans, current physical condition, and quality of food while following ketogenic diet. As you can see there are numerous factors that come into play when saying a diet is good or bad. I think people should take the time look at the research and speak with various authorities in regards to low carb diets before drawing conclusions from the they says.

Relevant research in regards to ketogenic dieting  
Efficacy and safety of the ketogenic diet for intractable childhood epilepsy: Korea multicentric experience  
Chul Kang H, Joo Kim Y, Wook Kim D, Dong Kim H,  
Dept of pediatrics, Epilepsy center, Inje Univ Coll of Med, Sanggye Paik Hospital, Seoul Korea

The purpose of the study was to evaluate the safety of the ketogenic diet, and to evaluate the prognosis of the patients after successful discontinuation of the diet in infants, children and adolescents with refractory epilepsy. The study looked at patients who had been treated with KD during 1995 through 2003 at Korean multicenters. The outcomes of the 199 patients enrolled in the study at 6 and 12 months were as follows: 68% and 46% of patients remained on the diet, 58% and 41% showed a reduction in seizures, including 33% and 25% who became seizure free. The complications were mild during the study, but 5 patients died during the KD. No significant variables were related to the efficacy, but those with symptomatic and partial epilepsies showed more frequent relapse after completion of the diet. The researchers concluded the KD is a safe and effective alternative therapy for intractable epilepsy in Korea, although the customary diet contains substantially less fat than traditional Western diets, but life-threatening complications should be monitored closely during follow up.",True,1,1.0,0,HTC365,False,False,keto

1641411361,Mind changed! Didn't think I could do this.,"A few years ago, I was looking for a solution to my increasing migraines. Keto and low carb popped up as options, but at the time, I dismissed them after some investigation:

* I couldn't tolerate dairy, so that would be quite limiting.
* I dislike eggs, so that would be even more limiting.
* I'm fructose intolerant, so was fearful of striking even more ingredients off my list of ""safe"" foods.
* Let's admit it, I was hopelessly addicted to carbs.

(Thank you to the kind people who gave me advice on this sub back then!)

Fast forward to today: I have been on a high fat, low carb diet for the last 87 days. I started off on moderate low carb, and then quickly shifted to keto as I grew accustomed to not relying on carbs and learned how to navigate my macros and food sources.

I have actually been able to reintroduce fatty dairy (butter, cream, cheese) into my diet without any ill effects. What a glory! I had really missed this.

So what was it that made me give keto a shot after all?

Poor health. Shitty health, to be precise. I was diagnosed with PCOS on top of my migraines in August. The migraines had reached a relentless level of frequency and duration. My hormones were out of whack. I was steadily gaining weight. I was hungry all the time, no matter what or how much I ate. I had developed acne (I'm in my 40s FFS). My sleep was suffering. Something had to change. 

The hormone specialist who diagnosed me threw prescriptions for 7 different medications at me. I started taking them and within a short space of time felt even worse (mood plummeted dangerously, blood glucose started creeping up). I stopped taking them (except for progesterone and vitamin D, which I felt good with) and did my research instead, and learned that LCHF or keto is the way to go, and could possibly spare me taking any meds if I did it right.

I redid the bloodwork and other tests in December to see if things had improved, and they have:

* Hormones are back in normal healthy ranges.
* Fastig blood glucose is really good, and very stable throughout the day.
* HbA1c has improved.
* Cortisol has improved.
* Insulin has improved.
* HDL has finally increased a bit, and is now in the healthy range (this is a first, it has been low all my life).
* LDL has increased a bit, but is fine.
* BMI is back in a normal range.

And the best thing? I had only 2 hours of migraine within the past month and that resolved without medication on its own. Compare that to the 12 days (!) of migraine I used to get monthly, often hitting the limit of how much migraine medication I can take. As you can imagine, I am extremely grateful.

Other interesting changes:

* My food cravings have completely changed - I crave wonderful fresh green vegetables now instead of grains and sugar.
* Intermittent fasting is easier now.
* Altered sense of taste - I can detect sweetness in the most minute quantities. 
* I have less appetite for meat.
* I need more salt.
* I can detect when I am thirsty (this was impaired before).
* My food expenses are much lower.
* I eat more veg now than ever before in my life.

I can now see that LCHF/keto is absolutely fine and practicable for me. I am sticking to this long term. I may have dismissed it back then, but it turns out that I just needed enough suffering to motivate myself :)

\----&gt;&gt;&gt; So if there others out there like me who doubt they can pull it off because they can't or don't want to eat eggs and dairy, it absolutely can be done. &lt;&lt;&lt;----

Lots of keto recipe websites seem to have a million eggy milky recipes, but there is really a lot that you can do just with healthy fats, veg and meat.

Here are a few of my favourite new meals - not an egg in sight:

* Zucchini noodles with tomato sauce
* Stir fry with chicken and whatever low carb veg you have lying around
* Homemade cream of veg soup (broccoli, zucchini, spinach or cauliflower - or all of them together with herbs)
* Chicken or beef curry (I use unsweetened coconut yogurt to make the sauce creamy) - no rice or naan, of course
* Salads in all sorts of varieties, with homemade dressings (without sugar of course)
* Roasted non-starchy vegetables from the oven, especially if I toss in a few whole cloves of garlic
* Fried brussels sprouts (holy shit, I had no idea that they taste this good)
* Broccoli and green pepper quickly fried up and seasoned with a bit of soy sauce and a dash of sesame oil
* Cucumber with a tahini dip (not too much tahini, mixed with some water and vinegar)
* Unsweetened hot chocolate made with almond milk and a bit of coconut cream
* Chicken and veg tajine
* Tuna with seasoned seaweed
* Avocado any which way
* Green peppers stuffed with minced beef",True,1,1.0,0,Flock_with_me,False,False,keto
1641412303,Keto rash after 1.5 years. Is this a bad sign?," Hello. I've been on vegan keto for about 1 and a half years. I recently  did a 7 day extended water fast. On the second day after breaking my  fast I developed a keto rash (itchy red bumps on my chest). I've done  shorter 3 and 5 day fasts during the keto diet as well but no rash  occurred those times. Throughout my time doing the keto diet I never  developed a keto rash, so I'm worried that I never really achieved keto  this whole time and I had just been doing a very low carb diet.  
So I'm wondering if anyone has any insight into this, have I  been doing keto wrong this whole time? I shoot to eat less than 50  carbs a day, usually eating less than that. Oh also I should note I  definitely experienced ""keto flu"" when I first started the keto diet.  Thanks for any insights!",True,1,1.0,0,smthngaboutapolrbear,False,False,keto

[https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/health/keto-diet-misinformation/](https://plantbasednews.org/lifestyle/health/keto-diet-misinformation/)  


Main issue, amongst many-  


""As a cardiologist, I believe the keto diet is a mistake. The keto diet, I believe, is based on misinformation,” said Dr. Ostfeld.

“The general theme is that in the 1980s, the government told us to eat low fat. Then we ate low fat and look at us now: we’re fat and sick. It’s a really nice narrative, but it’s not true. We ate more of everything, including fat.

“So it’s based, I think, on fake news. There is no long-living population that is consistently in a state of ketosis. And the one population that often comes up is the Inuit population and they live very far North, near the Pole, and eat a lot of fish.

Well, they have similar heart disease rates as people in Canada, and actually the Inuit population, they’ve selected for a mutation, that makes it harder for them to go into ketosis, suggesting that it is not evolutionarily beneficial to be in a chronic state of ketosis.""  


[https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000673](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000673)  


This article shows data from a study done on Inuits following a native, almost pure carnivore diet, pre-1968. The main takeaways:  


"" The incidence of ischaemic heart disease based on autopsy studies was just 1% in Alaskan Inuit (1956–1958)[2 3](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000673#ref-2) versus 18.44% (1950–1955)[5](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000673#ref-5) in the USA and just 2% in Alaskan Inuit (1959–1968) but 30% in the USA (1964).[2 6 7](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000673#ref-2) Thus, the data suggest that the traditional Alaskan Inuit (based on autopsy studies from the 1950s and 1960s) had around 1/15th to 1/18th the rate of death from ischaemic heart disease compared with the USA at the time. ""  


"" In summary, based on X-ray exams, older Alaskan natives had about one-half to one-third the rate of atherosclerosis compared with 14 other more westernised populations on autopsy. Autopsy studies in the mid-to-late 1950s in Alaskan Inuit showed around one-fifth the rate of death from cardiovascular disease (5.8%) as compared with those in the USA (30.6%) during the same time period, and based on autopsy studies, the rate of death from ischaemic heart disease in Alaskan Inuit was around 1/18th that of the USA (1% vs 18.44%).[2](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000673#ref-2) Future studies with a more robust design may be needed to more accurately confirm these findings. ""  


"" Conclusion

The traditional Alaskan Inuit diet consisted of less 10% of total calories as carbohydrate. Even with the introduction of sugar, early on, the total intake would have been less than 5% of total calories. Nowadays, however, sugar-sweetened beverages are the main sources of calories in Alaskan natives[14](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000673#ref-14) with added sugars making up 20% of the total caloric intake compared with 14% of calories consumed in general US population.[15 16](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000673#ref-15) Importantly, a higher intake of low-nutrient-dense carbohydrates is associated with a higher rate of type 2 diabetes in Alaskan natives.[17](https://openheart.bmj.com/content/4/2/e000673#ref-17) The evidence suggests that an increase in the intake of refined carbohydrates and sugar may have contributed to the health decline of the Alaskan Inuit. Thus, a reduction in the intake of refined carbohydrates and sugar may drastically improve the health of Alaskan natives.""",True,1,1.0,1,youmuzzreallyhateme,False,False,keto

I lost my hair, my period and I was really exhausted - why? Because I developed fear of food, I was under 1200kcal per day and my eating disorder was at serious level. I was not happy with myself because I was not aware what I accomplished. Now I can see that it was the moment when I should get back on normal track but of course step by step. But of course I did not do it, I was pushing myself that hard that I organise my weekly menu in advance, all what I was worrying about was scale and to be honest I wasn’t myself anymore. Because of my strict life style I developed some habits that were good but also ones that were really bad for my mental health. For example I have tendecy to get my self to that workhard levet that I end up with burnout, and it was even before my eating disorder but with it it was even worse. In august I had serious burn out at my work and I started to eat carbs, not good ones but sweets (and whole my life i wasn’t fan of sweets at all), after I ate them I felt so bad that I go to toilet and throw up. I wasn’t aware and there was already December - me being 10kilograms heavier, puking every day and eating shitty food, trying to get back to track but actually was on the same place as 1,5 year before. Now I need to do it, because of myself to prove that I am strong enough to start and finish what I did before. I want to feel beautiful and happy again, but I do not know where to even start.

How do you do keto long term and maintain a good relationship with food?,"So, I’ve been on quite a journey healing my PCOS and losing weight. I started in August of 2019 doing keto and intermittent fasting. I lost 90 pounds in 15 months. I was REALLY into the keto and fasting crowds. Like, borderline being a zealot and telling everyone they should do keto. 

I ended up doing some experimenting, trying to keep an open mind, and went through some other weight loss camps that mostly preached CICO and high protein, along with more flexible dieting. So I began to experiment with adding in carbs. Long story short, I ended up gaining some weight back (like 20-30 pounds) because I felt like even when I added in healthy carbs (oats, potatoes, rice) I felt like my cravings and hunger immediately were out of control like they used to be. 

For the last year I have tried to make this work and it just isn’t. I just cannot seem to get my cravings and hunger under control unless I’m in at least a light state of ketosis. I wanted to be this agnostic diet person that is more level-headed and not a keto zealot, and to take a balanced approach towards food and not demonize carbs. But, I just can’t help but feel like maybe, especially for some women with PCOS, that maybe low carb or keto really is the best diet for me?

I have been losing steadily (1-2 pounds a week with a few bigger weeks in there), and like I said in my post on my 300th day of keto - I’ve definitely learned that weight loss isn’t liner. Since Dec 18th I’ve been gaining and losing the same 3 pounds! I could see the 100 pound mark and it was so hard to not go crazy and start severely restricting just to get there so I could say I lost 100 pounds in 2021. But I have a been and I just kept to it - and this morning was rewarded with a big 5.1 loss woosh (that hasn’t happened for a while too me!).

I’m so excited but also in disbelief. When I started in March - the idea that I could ever loss 100 pounds was so foreign to me… I just never had any success.

1641573874,Long &amp; circuitous story about body image/inflammation/chronic illness &amp; keto's impact on my life,"I've always had a difficult relationship with food &amp; body image. In high school I was hovering around 145 and thought I was fat (I'm 5'7 and 145 was absolutely not fat, in retrospect), so I dropped 20 lbs one summer by running every day and came back to school looking really thin. I got a lot more attention -- mostly good, but also some unnecessary comments about how I was too thin. I continued to be weight-conscious and dropped more weight my senior year until I was hovering around 115 lbs.

Then college happened. I started birth control and filled out, but maintained a weight around 135-145 over the four years. I felt pretty confident in that range. After college I was in a long term relationship with my now husband, and I let a little ""love weight"" creep in. By the time I was 26, I weighed around 150-155. I cried every time the doctor weighed me. I refused to get on scales. I decided I would stop taking my birth control because I was convinced it was making me gain weight and found it impossible to lose.

In the years since stopping birth control (I am now 33), I found out I have an inflammatory &amp; chronic illness called Endometriosis that the pill was masking for a decade. As I tried to drop some lbs, I found that exercise was very painful because of my illness. Trudging through any type of cardio exercise left me on the floor in agony. I felt incredibly defeated. I loved exercise and I thought it was the only thing that could help me lose weight. At some point, around my 30th birthday, I gave up on regular exercise because it became too painful for me.

I had ignored scales at every doctor appointment in my late 20s through 2020. I actually had no idea how much I weighed at all, for several years. One year ago today (exactly!) I finally had a surgical procedure to remove the Endometriosis tissue from my pelvic organs that was plaguing me for years. They had to weigh me to administer the correct dose of anesthesia. I had approximated 165 lbs at all my appointments, but when I finally got on the scale to reveal 182, I broke down. The nurse actually said, ""you don't look that heavy,"" which I thought was a horrible thing to say &amp; I'll probably never forget that moment.

After my surgery, I decided to be much more health conscious and ate fewer inflammatory foods. I still couldn't shake my weight.  I found that the surgery improved a lot of things in my life, but the exercise pain never truly went away (my hunch is that it's nerve related). I was pretty defeated and went back to some bad eating habits in an effort to boost some dopamine, I guess. I decided that I'd try to be happy in my body, regardless of the scale. But I was also looking to prolong my post-surgery improvement of symptoms. Endometriosis grows back over time for most people, and I'd been doing a lot of research about the negative impact of inflammatory foods on new Endo growth. I knew I wanted to make a change, but food was still something I took a lot of comfort in (especially during COVID).

Fast forward to September 2021. I was out with friends and someone took a photo of me. I try not to be so negative about my appearance, but the image of myself made me cringe. I thought maybe since my surgery I had lost some weight, but this photo was revealing otherwise. By October, I finally had the courage to get on my scale and I was 180 lbs.

The day I weighed myself and faced my truth was the day I decided to give keto a try. I had read so much about it with regard to reducing inflammation in your body, but I also just wanted to feel more confident about my appearance. On 10/8/2021, I downloaded the Carb Manager app. I started using a food scale. I researched all the keto-friendly dessert options, because I have an insatiable sweet tooth (Lily's is by far the best brand out there -- FIGHT ME). I bought keto alternatives everywhere. My husband &amp; some of my friends rolled their eyes at me when we'd go out to dinner and I had a thousand questions for the waiter about how the food was prepared. Honestly? I'm not sure people thought I would stick with it. People told me it was a fad diet. They're not wrong, but I can also see myself maintaining a low carb diet (under 100g net carbs) for the rest of my life.

By December I had lost nearly 20 lbs. My husband and I were going on a two week vacation to Maui. I spent hours on keto reddit threads reading about how others maintained keto on vacation. I was so torn about it; on the one hand, I wanted to enjoy all the food. On the other, I didn't want all my hard work to slip away. I decided to do my best, not stress too much about it, and at the very least, stick to a low carb diet instead of the strict 20g net carbs I'd been doing. I didn't find it TOO difficult to maintain this, and I definitely had some ""cheat"" moments (I hate that word &amp; the negative connotations surrounding it). When I came back, I hadn't gained a pound. I felt victorious. And honestly? The cinnamon roll &amp; mai tai I had on my ""cheat day"" didn't make me miss or long for those foods afterwards. I was actually a little repulsed/shocked by how sweet they were.

I should also mention that my Endometriosis symptoms have done a 180 on keto. For all my ladies out there, I'd been living on Advil each month of my period. A little less so after my surgery, which was great, but keto had completely changed my life. There have been a couple of times where I didn't know I got my period. I am a firm believer that eating keto has significantly reduced inflammation in my pelvic region. It would seem that for all those years, sugar was completely ruining me and probably making me much sicker.

Since my Endo surgery one year ago today, I have lost 27 lbs (25 lbs from keto). I used to cry about being 155 lbs in my 20s, but now I feel excellent. I'm 33 years old, living through a pandemic, &amp; dealing with the emotional implications of having a chronic illness after a decade of medical gaslighting. I decided to give myself some grace and also appreciate what my mind is capable of (as y'all know, maintaining keto takes a ton of mental fortitude).

I've been a long time lurker on several Reddit/Keto threads and so I wanted to tell my story and give thanks to everyone in the community. Your posts and stories have guided me, and I hope I can pay it forward. Keep on and keto on (I promise that plateau will pass).

So I've been on keto for a week now. I've done keto before (longest a month) and had no issues.

I switched to keto on the 1st and struggle to eat more than 500 calories. I try to limit dairy and I don't eat pork My stomach feels weak when I eat and I don't feel hungry. I usually eat 3 boiled eggs and some meat and I'm stuffed.
I think my body adjusted to OMAD. I don't think it's keto flu, I've been using pink Himalayan salt and eating greens.

1641613584,"Lost 20Kg Using Keto Diet Described in the FAQ, Recovering Sex Drive and finally ready to Transition","OK, So several months ago I decided to do a Keto diet after a good friend of mine lost a lot of weight doing it. It was kind of a last straw for me as if it wasn't successful I was planning on asking my Doctor about Weight Loss Surgery (seemingly only 7% of people my weight manage to become healthy without medical assistance). 

I used this subreddit (as a lurker) to work out how to go about it and it's been good so far. I had some headaches at the start for a week or so but fine since then and I've now lost 20Kg as of today! That's 44lbs apparently. I've still got a goal of losing another 30-40Kg to get in a healthy BMI range but I'm starting to feel confident I can do it.

For the first time in my life, it seems, I can eat a meal and actually feel full. Honestly it's a pretty strange feeling to me even months later, and I generally don't feel hungry between meals, of which I'm having once a day.

Lastly, I seem to be developing a more healthy sex drive (I'd written my general lack of it to medication not weight) and I'm confident enough to start making moves to Transition (if that's the right word) as I've thought for some time I am Non-Binary or Gender Fluid, but couldn't cope with the idea of being a fat woman (though accepting being a fat man).

1641614618,Please share an effective method to lose the last 10 pounds,"I have had the same weight, more or less, over the last year - 120 pounds. This is my pre-pregnancy weight more or less. I have initially lost pregnancy weight a year ago and kept to keto 80% of the time over the last year. When I go off keto (holidays 2-3 times per year), I gain weight very quickly. 

Over the last 3 weeks I have been eating absolutely everything (not junk food, but lots of good old carbs, which are super addicting) and only gained 2 pounds, which I lost over the last two days after eating only beef, chicken and a bit of cheese. I think the trick was that I decided to indulge, so I stopped putting coconut oil in everything and eating 3 avocados in one go (like I am used to), and just indulged in a bit of protein and some carbs, which kept calories low overall. Eating carbs freely just convinced me again they are not worth it, puffy face, bloating etc.. 

The issue is that I want to lose these last 10 pounds permanently, going back to my weight from 6 years ago. Could you please share some tricks how to achieve this as my current weight seems to be the weight that my body is used to, but losing even 5-7 pounds would be so good for me. It makes a big difference visually. I don’t care if it’s slow progress…. It’s just so hard to lose even 2 pounds now for some reason. 

I do weights / pilates 3 times a week, but that doesn’t affect the weight. 

I tried OMAD but I don’t feel well mentally fasting for that long. I do some fasting, I usually eat my first meal at 1 pm, but my last little snack might be 9 or 10 pm (e.g. a piece of cheese). Since I have done some carb cycling and only gained some water weight, how can I make a bit of a push now and lose these last few pounds? Any tricks?

I'm sure I get plenty of regular salt because I salt *everything*. I'm going to try some ketoade to see if that helps so I have some questions:

I don't want to use magnesium citrate because of the potential laxative effect. I realize that not much is used in ketoade, but I'm already having intestinal difficulties while I adjust to my fat intake. Don't want to add to that. What else could I use?

How much ketoade should I drink in a day?

I kind of hovered around that mark until 2017 and was up to 245.

On July 11th 2017 I decided to try keto. I made it to onderland in December of 2017 and celebrated by eating fast food and all sorts of bad food.  Obviously not smart. 

I’ve bounced off and on gaining weight since then. Every time my weight would get to 220/230 I would diet again. During the months where I wasn’t strict kept I was still doing lazy Keto. So I would never get below 210 nor above 230. 

Enter covid and increased in alcohol consumption. I was drinking everyday. Honestly a functioning alcoholic. I also ate whatever the heck I wanted. September of 2021 I got up to 250. I woke up on September 25th and decided. No more alcohol. Back to keto. Time to stop being a fat ass.

1641744193,"Just seeking confirmation I'm on the right track. I need to see change, desperately!!!","Hey All!

I'm done with walking around with a food baby belly. So I'm here trying to do something about it. I've tried strength training for a few months last year paired with a 500-200 calorie deficit. Honestly, I didn't notice any changes in measurements, weight or aesthetic... It was pretty discouraging (not why I stopped, Uni and life got pretty full on).

Anyway, decided to finally give KETO + Deficit + Strength Training + Cardio a go. My aim is to lose as much fat as possible as quick as possible. If I'm able to see physical change quickly, then I can stay motivated (really hard for me with ADHD lol).

So here's my game plan and info, just wondering if you legends could confirm or chime in on what needs to be adjusted/tweaked.

Male - 24y/o - 180cm/5'11 - 86kg/189lb - BF 27% (Navy Method)

Strength Training with Progressive weekly overload (6 days total, Push, Pull, Legs, Rest, Repeat). Cardio (LISS) 30min before strength training, 30-1hr after. (7 days a week, 1-1.5hr on rest day).

Macros/Calories according to KETOGains Calculator: 1,726 Resting Metabolic Rate 1,614 Training Total Calories (Protein 138g, Carbs 20g, Fat 88g).

My diet: Breakfast - Eggs, Bacon, Beef Sausage. Lunch/Dinner - Salad w/ Chicken breast or Broccoli with Salmon. Snack - Yoghurt (rarely). Lots of water and black coffee no sugar.

As far as I'm aware everything should be good. I'm only really one week into Keto, some days I have gone over with Carbs due to miscalculations by 10-15g.

Am I doing it right? Thanks in advance!!!",True,1,1.0,0,altezzaforever,False,False,keto

1641747680,17 days into keto. My struggle with T2 and chronic pancreatitis.,"Hi. Just wanted to share a bit about my lifelong struggle with a lot of issues and how Keto is changing my life. 

I had been always obese since when I was very young. In 2010 I reached my heaviest weight of 295 pounds. I was 34y then. 6 feet 1 inch, 46 waist and looked like 50 years old. I had T2 diabetes since I was 25, being born with chronic pancreatitis, I spent most of my childhood going back and forth in hospitals and under morphine to manage pain.  Also dealing with severe migraine and fibromyalgia. At this time I was taking almost 150 units of insulin (basal and rapid) combined and still had poor control. My doctor suggested an insulin pump, which scared me enough to make a change. 

Sometime in March of 2010, I bought a treadmill and started running. Slowly I fell in love with it and over the next 3 years I kept my addiction going with a very strict low fat diet. I lost 90 pounds and was a waist 35 by 2013. I felt super good, looked younger and couldn’t be happier. Running was an addiction and I ran almost 30-40 miles every week. But my weight loss has stopped. I was at 200 pounds and wanted to lose another 15. But no matter what I did, I didn’t go below 200. I got desperate. I found Keto. Sounded just wonderful and I started right away. In September 2014 I went a month with strict keto and lost 5 pounds. This is the time I started weight training and hired a personal trainer at my gym. 7 days into it, I realized it was a big mistake, since I was naive and the trainer trained me too hard. I had both shoulders frozen and extreme pain in both knees. I couldn’t run or workout. It took a year  to heal (still not 100%) and I stopped running, went off keto and to regular diet. 

I gained back to 220 pounds and since then have been stuck on that. To manage my diabetes share nice then I had been on Farxiga and Victoza. I tolerated them well for 5 years. Last year I started having pancreatitis pains again (which had stopped due to multiple celiac blocks I got in 2011). I found out that it was victoza inflaming my pancreas. And Farxiga creating other issues. I had to stop both and went back to high doses of basal and rapid insulins. Almost 150 units again with poor control. 

Despite eating less (1600 calories) and on IF I gained 10 pounds within 1 month. 

On Dec 23rd, 2021. I got scared once more and started keto. Since then I am down 10 pounds, my pain and inflammation are gone, I have stopped all 150 units of insulin. The best part? I went to a theme park yesterday with my kids and I couldn’t find anything to eat, but for the first time I didnt cave in. Came home and had a good keto pizza. Lol. 

FYI there is no other diet that works for my T2. I have been lurking on this subreddit for a while and getting most of my answers and inspiration from you awesome folks.

1641748752,"Keto round 2, here we go!","tl;dr: lost a lot of weight on keto during the pandemic but did no exercising and hated how I looked, gained most of it back once I could go to take out/fast food places again, would appreciate advice on how to make round 2 better.


I started keto at the beginning of the pandemic, at the time I was probably around 290 lbs and in very poor health. Take out and fast food were (are) my mortal enemy, I despise cooking and doing dishes so ordering something for a lazy after-work weeknight was always preferable for me. I also happened to be a bit of a binge eater. Often I would get a large sub and fries or a whole meal along with a couple of dollar menu items at a fast food place and just eat in front of the TV until I couldn't physically eat anymore, then follow it up with half a pint of Ben and Jerry's. However, I (and my bank account) knew I had to make a change, and my therapist had recommended that I try keto. 

At the time keto was easy for me to do. Restaurants were deemed unsafe and I was forced to cook my own food (the threat of catching a deadly virus can be a good motivator). Within a year or so I managed to get down to a low of about 190, the lightest I had ever been in my adult life. My doctor did a couple of health tests during my journey and every time they said ""whatever you're doing, keep it up"". My blood pressure was finally normal and my blood work (including cholesterol) was all normal. I was buying large sized shirts (from 3XL) and 32 waist jeans (from 42, I'm fairly short so I'm guessing I have a small waist without all the fat). People at work barely recognized me and everybody couldn't believe the progress I had made and wanted to know my secret. 

However, I was not happy with the way I looked. I basically looked like a deflated/sickly version of myself. One person at work even asked if I was ill because I had lost so much weight in such a short amount of time. I had also oddly experienced some hair loss during this time (which seemed to slow/stop once I stopped keto). Even though I was on keto I was not exercising at all and was going from my bed, to my desk, to my couch, then back to my bed every day. I also never felt the renewed energy that others said they felt on this sub (and yes I did all the electrolyte/mg stuff). 

Also my mortal enemy, restaurants, were finally open for business again, and my friends wanted to go out to eat all the time. I couldn't resist all of the carb-loaded foods and sugary sweets anymore. Combine that with a pretty bad bought of depression and I ended up dropping back into my poor eating habits. 

I went back to all of my bad eating habits, the binge eating, the take out, everything. I ended up putting most of the weight back on that I had lost. I watched those large shirts go back to XL, then to XXL. I watched my pants go back to 34 then to 36, and now even those are a struggle to put on. I already donated all of my really big clothes so I knew I couldn't afford to keep gaining weight unless I wanted to buy bigger clothes again. Once again I knew I had to make a change. 

So far I've been back on keto for about a week. It's been a bit of a struggle but I'm able to use all of the tips and tricks I learned from round 1 (thank to this wonderful sub) to help me ease into it a bit easier. I'm typing this post as a way to make the restart of my keto journey official, and also to see if anybody has had a similar experience and could offer advice as to how to avoid these pitfalls. I'm continuing to work with my therapist on my depression, and I know it's responsible for a good chunk of what's going on with me. I think exercise also needs to play a bigger role in round 2, and I would very much appreciate any tips for that as well. Thanks everybody!",True,1,1.0,2,cchalk0,False,False,keto

When asked about cereal, bread, pasta, rice or sweets of course the answer is yes, I do eat a lot of those.

It's hard to hear these people talking about how they eat so much chicken, or don't eat protein hardly at all, because they think red meat causes heart disease.

Of course, most of these patients patting themselves on the back about avoiding red meat are overweight and/or on several medications. 

The reason I went into primary care was to educate people on diet. Ie, it's not red meat or fat that's the culprit. It's carbohydrates. The problem is, because healthcare is profit-driven in the US, I often don't have time to explain this fully to them. 

It's depressing to hear this answer every time I ask. These people are fully brainwashed by one headline, ""Red meat linked to cardiovascular disease"" that they saw a few years ago. But somehow they don't think twice about 50% of their diet being carbohydrates.

This past week I was sick on one of my nights, so barred from cooking. (No argument there, no one wants a sick cook!) That means this week I have to make three dinners... but I still only get home early enough to cook two nights, so I need to make one ahead for another night at the same time I'm cooking one for that night.

**Complication**: I am a ***slow*** cook, and not a great one (though not horrible).

**Request**: Can someone help me come up with a pair of recipes that I can make at the same time, where one can be frozen or refrigerated for a later night?

I have chicken and hamburger (enough for two meals each, so it doesn't have to be one each) and a wide variety of veggies. For cooking, I have a stove, an oven, an instant pot, and a microwave, although I would prefer to not use the stove for both things at the same time (I distract easily). It would be helpful if the ingredients for both recipes had some matching items, had relatively short lists, and were limited to things that most people on a keto diet had at hand (except thickeners). I do have a zoodle maker.

That said, I should be able to pick up anything commonly available at a grocery store, and can prep some ingredients ahead of time if that's doable.

**Addendum**: I am not on the keto diet myself, but the others ARE, so I cook keto unless cooking for myself. Please presume I have less knowledge of the keto diet than average if it matters for the recipes.

I started feeling this way since I began to avoid juices and fruits and only stayed with rice and a lot of vegetables, Nowadays I'm in keto diet and the feeling has been getting worse, yes, I have mental clarity like many of you guys but I'm starting to have derealization symptoms like lack of taste (It's not covid I swear), obsessive blinking, compulsive behaviour and I think is due to the lack of absorption of essential amino acids like  **tryptophan** due to the results of an investigation I read about related to the importance of insulin for improving the absorption of these amino acids. 

I read as well that if I added a bowl of blueberries and raspberries or strawberries, which are better in Glycemic index than blueberries, to my meals, once a day, I'd be improving my insulin levels to the required level without overpassing the net carbs limit in my daily meals. What do you know about this? I think the investigation had it right ! have you guys felt the same like me?

How can I know if the amount of strawberries, tomatoes and lettuce or raspberries is right for the 23 g of net carbs so that I don't quit ketosis ? I don't have any scale for measuring its weight or mass. sorry I'm bad at that subject !

However, I’m not hungry most of the time and if I eat when I’m not hungry I feel awful - like almost nauseous but I’m worried that I’m only eating half of the calories. I always meet and many times exceed my protein (76g), my fat intake has been low (30-40g) even though my limit is 94g, and my net carb intake is usually around 15g. For days 1-4 I was averaging 1100 calories.

I started keto for weight loss but I’ve always ate like a bird. I don’t know if I’m just adjusting to eating better and going back to how I usually eat (as in I have a larger lunch and basically a snack for dinner) since I’m not craving anything and feeling like I need to eat since I cut carbs or what? I suppose I’m worried if only eating 600-700 calories is sufficient or rather this is just me and I don’t need more if my body isn’t telling to me to eat more?

1641793749,Insomnia,"Hello everyone

So I started doing Keto on the 3rd of January this month. I have done Keto two times already. The first time was two years ago, but I stopped because I couldnt keep up with all the fats. I felt it was too much for me, though I have to admit it was me not knowing enough about the foods.

The second time I experienced very bad Keto flue. My muscles were super tired, I was super tired and it scared me enough to stop.

Now, half a year later I want to try again and I am successful so far.

My goal is to lose weight and that not just a little bit, but quite a lot. About 70kgs less is my long-term goal. I am quite obese and finally want to get rid of it.

Now I have googled on that topic quite a bit here and there and most people say I am lacking magnesium and potassium- possibly.

Like I'm going to sleep at around 10pm in the evening, maybe fall asleep at around 11, but I wake up between 3-5 am every morning and that started on the 3rd right away. I am not drinking any coffee in the evening, but I do have to nap for a few hours throughout the day, otherwise my eyes would just fall close. 

Now I am not sure how to fix it and I hope someone could give me a few tips maybe? I am slowly losing my mind over this, since work will start soon again.",True,1,1.0,0,Misskalkuliert,False,False,keto

1641808941,"My general issue with diets and ""brain-power""","Hi, guys!   


New here, got some keto-related questions. But first, some relevant personal history:  
I have been struggling with my weight for the past 15 years. Initially too skinny, then accumulated too much fat. Been on many diets, but bounced back afterwards, due to my eating &amp; drinking habbits. I have also abused alcohol in the past (2 weeks sober now, it's sometimes hard, but I'm holding on). I am 10kg (22lbs) over my desired weight. Looking for a lifestyle change, if possible, so I'm thinking about keto.  


My main concern is my work. I'm in IT and I work a lot, so I need my brain to function at 100%. Some diets I have been on seem like such a strain on my system. As in, I'm always hungry and I find it hard to perform at work. Sometimes I feel dizzy. I also find myself in a constant state of nervousness and iritiability. Hanger is real, people, haha!   


So here are my questions:  


A. I've read about the keto-flu, but that seems to be a one week thing, not so bad, I can handle that. What about the rest of the time? Do you feel like you perform the same at work? Tell me about your experience :)

B. Is keto effective at weight-loss on its own even without proper CICO or fasting?  


C. In your experience, what was the weight loss efficiency, with keto? (weight / time)

1641823483,What to Know About the Keto Diet After 50," 

&amp;#x200B;

**The keto diet (also known as the ketogenic diet) requires you to make significant dietary modifications. Carbohydrates, such as bread, cereals, grains, and even many fruits and vegetables, are severely restricted in this high-fat, low-protein diet.**

**The keto diet might be difficult to stick to, but some people find that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks when they do. The keto diet may be beneficial to those over 50 since it has the ability to promote weight loss, blood sugar control, and maybe protect against heart disease.**

**However, there are hazards to this eating plan, and you should always see your doctor or a qualified nutritionist before beginning any new diet.**

**What Is the Keto Diet and How Does It Work?**

**It's only a half-fast. When you eat carbohydrates, your blood sugar rises, and this sugar fuels the body's cells. When you don't eat carbs for a long time, your blood sugar levels drop, and your liver begins to use stored body fat as a source of energy. It's similar to having a backup system for your body. Ketosis is the name for this process.**

**Because the keto diet isn't a complete fast, your body still has a source of energy and you can keep your muscle mass.**

**Ketogenic Diet Approved Foods**

**The keto diet consists of a high-fat, moderate-protein, low-carbohydrate diet. Your body will reach a state of ketosis if you do this properly and regularly for 2-3 weeks.**

**The keto diet follows a macronutrient ratio (fat, protein, and carbs). Typical fat-to-protein-to-carbohydrate ratios are 4:1 or 3:1, which means your diet will have 4 or 3 grams of fat for every 1 gram of protein and carbohydrate combined. This equates to approximately 70% to 80% fat, 20% to 30% protein, and 10% to 15% carbohydrate. This equates to about 165 grams of fat, 75 grams of protein, and 40 grams of carbohydrate in a typical 2000-calorie diet.**",True,1,0.99,1,Kind_hhikf,False,False,keto

Typically around 38-41g per box, and some of the ""healthy alternatives"" seemed to have more carbs than the regular pasta packages did... 

So my question is, I thought this stuff was supposed to be ""healthier"" and low carb? How do you get around this on a low carb or keto diet? I guess some people probably just cut pasta out completely which makes sense.. unfortunately I cook for my family in the instant pot quite a bit and most of those recipes are centered around noodles or some sort of chicken or beef pasta. it just seems like there isn't any real keto or low carb alternative noodle options (at the store I was in, anyway).

I started on Keto years ago and managed to lose some weight. After the death of my brother I got derailed and put it back on plus more. This year I'm going to be a parent for the first time so I have made the conscious decision to get healthy. I want to be able to play with my kid and be active.

I'm female, 159cm (5'2). **My starting weight was 102 kg (224 lbs)**.

5 days on keto and **I am now 98.7kg (217 lbs)**.

4) The change in weight loss was sudden, not gradual. It wasn't slowing down, it just suddenly stopped completely. I doubt it was fat-free tissue loss, since that would show as a deceleration over time.

A lot of times when I got back into doing well with keto, I got frustrated with the slow and difficult progress (due to the repeated yo-yoing, of course). For the most part I really kept returning to it more because it helps me feel better generally than specifically to lose weight. But y'all, vanity aside, I *do* need to lose some of this chonk. 

Back in late October, I already knew one of my goals for the new year was specifically to stop waffling so much with my eating habits. And so I started trying to do better at that point. Even all through Thanksgiving and Xmas and NYE, I stuck to keto friendly foods and snax recipes.

Now, 5 lbs over a few months (about 2, I think) doesn't feel like a *lot*. Largely because when I first really stuck to keto/low carb about 5 years ago, the weight loss was more dramatic. But I also recognize that losing 2.5 lbs/month is actually pretty reasonable (even if it is on the low side), and tbh even tho I've got a ways to go, I'm really happy with this progress so far, and the fact that I was dedicated enough to my goals to get a jumpstart on them rather than holding off for the new year.

If fruit is naturally available to us it almost feels wrong to almost completely avoid it (exception of avocado, berries and lemons). I did read that back in the day fruit would have only been available seasonally, thus humans would gorge on the available fruit to store/put on fat to get through the winter months where food was less readily available. This would make sense as to why we have fruit.

Do you think keto is healthy for a 21yo guy?

My current regime :

\- I avoid vegetable/ seed oils like the plague, and only use extra virgin coconut oil for cooking (i'm dairy free).

\- I have lots of saturated fat in my diet (current macro split is \~220f (150SF), 120p, 80c), and try to minimise PUFA intake.

\- Diet consists of basically pasture raised eggs, grass fed beef, ev coconut oil, dark chocolate, tomatoes, avocado, carrot, saurkraut, coconut yoghurt and raspberries (I avoid gluten, dairy, grains).

\- I gym 5/6 days a week. Also try to get a lot of sleep and sun, and avoid processed foods except dark chocolate.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Starting weight: 129.20kg (284.8 lbs).

Current Weight: 103.1 kg (227.3 lbs).

Target weight: 88 kg (194 lbs)

Male, 46 years old, 194cm (6 ft 4”), generally good health with no diagnosed issues (though I’m pretty sure if I’d seen a doctor four months back I’d have received a pretty crappy report).

In my fourth month of Keto I have managed to lose a further 3.3 kg to a total of 26.1 kg reduction. 

I've now cumulatively dropped 6.8 points on the BMI scale to 27.0 This puts me in the lower end of “overweight” as opposed to my start point on the cusp of “Obese class II”.

Measuring circumferences, I've dropped 13 cm from my chest, 19 cm from my belly and 14 cm from my waist.

This has been my lowest monthly weight loss and the reason simply put is Christmas. Christmas day and to some degree Christmas Eve and New Years eve were not keto compliant. Christmas Day in particular was 250 gross carbs, though I have to say that I suffered no effects from stepping out of, or back into ketosis. The only negative factor was the delaying of weight loss.

I have listed out non weight loss benefits previously and this month, I don’t particularly have much to add. It’s simply been a continuation of reducing in size and weight and feeling energised and healthy.

I have reversed five and a half years of weight gain in four months and I’m now lighter than when I got married.

I was forced to buy a few “intermediary” clothes as literally everything I owned was just hanging off me. My jeans size has reduced from a waist of 44” (that was tight) to a 36” that is loose. I’ll be 34” waist come the end of Jan. Jumpers and T-Shirts have reduced from XXL to XL. In terms of fit an L would work, but as I’m so tall, this size often is too short in the body/arms so I have always had to pick my battles there even when much thinner than currently.

Having punched four new holes into my belt last month, I am now on the last of these. In total I’ve reduced by ten holes on my belt and I’ll be reaching for the hole punch again shortly. I have always found this to be a very motivating thing.  Weight on the scale, photographs and other clothes tend to be a bit subjective, or don’t hang around for the whole course of the diet. But the belt is a constant, physical reminder of progress that is on me every waking moment.

My chest and belly measurements are within 1cm or each other. I barely have a protruding belly anymore and I feel quite slim. There’s still weight to lose, but it’s a whole body reduction now.

I continue to swim and have progressed over the two month from being able to swim only 50m without pause to 2.25 kilometres.

I have added in a regular sauna to my routine. Typically about 45 mins per session. It feels extraordinary, debilitating in the moment but then very energising afterwards. It’s too early to claim any health benefits from it as I have only been doing it for a week. But I am enjoying the experience.

Basically any and all health issues I had four months ago have gone. The bloating, fatigue, sweating, snoring, joint pain, crappy mood, lethargy, acid reflux, mild IBS etc. All gone. The quality of life improvement outside of the weight loss is nothing short of stunning.

I feel great, energised, alert, confident and with a greatly improved mood generally.

I remain deeply motivated to continue on this diet and supremely happy with the weight loss results and also the myriad of improvements made to my wider health.

Negatives this month:

I did have a target of hitting 100kg by Christmas, but it seemed like I was going to miss it even last month. I did miss it, and the Christmas cheat days certainly didn’t help.

I have unfortunately contracted Covid 10th Jan and so this is going to put the brakes on my exercise for the next few days as I isolate.

Thank you for reading this, I hope it is informative and if you have any questions I will most certainly answer them.

So I am keto and my parents are full blown vegans.... i'm sure you can imagine how that goes at family get togethers. Lately they become extremely pushy about me being keto and how meat is going to give me cancer and high blood pressure etc. I've shown them numerous studies to debunk these fears but of course they have fallen on deaf ears. Can anyone give me some good ways to politely tell them to back the hell off lol. I'm a 32 year old man and they treat me like a child.

1642010478,How to get hunger back?,"Hi guys, I'm (24F) not new to clean Keto, I was participating in this lifestyle few years ago and lost a good amount of weight. 

I have gotten really good with my macros and I am actually usually under 10g net carbs per day, it's just a result of the foods I prefer to eat. 

I started on Jan 3rd at 109.7 KG (241.8lbs) 
I dropped 3.3 kg ( 7 lbs) by Jan 9th but have since stalled for 2 days then increased in weight. 

I believe this has to do with me under eating this last week or so. For the last year or so my mental health was really bad and I resorted to carbs and sweets. Bingeing basically daily, I dont know how I didnt gain more weight than I did. 

But basically i'm thinking I may have shocked my body because of the sudden under eating, and now last few days I have stalled and felt really sluggish which I read could be due to my metabolism slowing down? Its strange because Im usually full of energy. 

Last time I had to be careful not to exceed 1800 calories a day, now I'm barely hitting 1000. Decided to slightly up my protein today and pretty much forced a big breakfast down. 

I am also on Vyvanse for ADHD and BED so during the day I can usually only have a snack so my day is usually:

Big Breakfast 9am 

""Snack"" 1pm 

Big Dinner 7pm 

Some type of sweet keto treat (fruit, fat bomb etc) before bed 


So it for sure pretty much impossible to eat on vyvanse, but just wondering how I can be hungry for breakfast and Dinner.

I have tried IF alone multiple times in the past but had no results, so this time I am trying IF with Keto as I find keto helps with my bloating SO MUCH. 

I fasted for 36 hours prior to starting keto diet a few days ago; broke my fast with one keto meal that day and was too full to have a second meal. 

Next few days I was trying to keep up with IF (16:8) but found myself pushing 18:6 as I wasn’t hungry. But now I’m finding it difficult to hit my calories (already at a 20% deficit) as fats keep me so satiated but then I get hungry hours into my fasting window.

I thought I'd share my results to inspire others who are looking into trying keto. 

I gained 60lbs from May 2020 to Dec 2021. I went to stay with my mom for a few weeks during winter break from college, and decided to try keto since she's been on it for 3 years. I've lost 22lbs so far.

For anyone interested, my carbs usually stay under 10g/day, and I've been averaging \~1200cal/day, no exercise. I'm not trying to eat so few calories, but the high protein intake (100+g/day) keeps me sated, my cravings are completely gone, and i've not experienced any negative effects from eating such a large deficit. (As someone who's suffered with BED my entire life, having no cravings is phenomenal.) 

I'm eating mostly carnivore (all animal products) with exceptions for seasonings and the occasional high fiber wrap or protein shake. I don't know if I would recommend what I'm doing though, I absolutely need to start going to the gym and eating vegetables. My diet is far from balanced.

I know that the weight loss will slow significantly, and I won't continue losing 20lb/month, but I'm hoping to hit my goal of 165 before the end of the year. Wish me luck!!! And best of luck to everyone here on this sub, you guys really inspire me.",True,1,1.0,0,birdgut,False,False,keto

I changed jobs in August and started as a bartender at a trendy artisanal pizza place. I literally eat pizza Every.Single.Day. They do have a small menu of not pizza foods (spaghetti or penne pasta, gnocchi, fried chicken, grilled cheese on the kids menu, arancini (rice and potato balls)). We don’t have a cauli crust and I can’t bring one (I asked even though I know it’s a health violation). We have GF but it’s rice flour based. 

Literally the only keto foods I can throw together for a meal are burrata (which I love), prosciutto, oven roasted chicken, and HB eggs. Everything else is either basically 100% carbs or stuff like meatballs which I don’t like. We get 50% discount on everything and it’s pretty much a given that you’re going to order food, when managers let you know they’re prepping for your break they literally say “Go ahead and put in (order) your food now”.

Like I said, there’s a few things I love, but I don’t have the tolerance to eat them day in and day out. I also have an 8yo and a 6yo who are in school and my schedule changes weekly.

I just can’t find the motivation and control to start cooking my food again to bring for lunch, or to suck it up and throw together a meal consisting of keto sides lol.

I do have a hot logic lunch bag, so I could absolutely bring something and cook it while I work until it’s time for my lunch, but I think maybe I’m just lazy. I want easy, delicious stuff right now. Sometimes I just cook shrimp and toss them in butter and enjoy them just like that! But those times have been few and far between. 

Much more often I find myself ordering at work, eating half or however much, and then finishing the rest at home (I’m also 4 years out from gastric sleeve surgery so I usually stretch one 10” pizza to last ~3 “meals”, but I don’t have set mealtimes for myself. Sometimes I’m home by 11, sometimes I roll in at 3, either way part of my bedtime routine is eating “dinner” or a large snack). 

Without just yelling at me to quit being lazy (because I already know), any advice for motivation and strength to KCKO is super appreciated.

1642080199,Unexpected gains in strength after two months on keto,"I recently had to move twice in one week (long story!). It was a horrible week needless to say and involved a ton of lifting heavy boxes etc. I noticed the following:

1) I had the energy and stamina to survive this nightmare of a week and get everything done. In my old high carb days I would have run out of gas and collapsed from exhaustion. I would have been completely overwhelmed.

2) Suddenly I have muscles! Before keto I had a lot of bloat and puffiness in my upper arms, as is common for women when they get into their forties. That is almost completely gone now and you can see muscle tone in my arms for the first time in I don't know long. It's most obvious in photos of me. I've been surprised to see that one of the areas of my body where I've lost the most weight is in my shoulders and upper arms.

3) I could carry heavy boxes with new strength in my upper body.

4) At the end of all of this I was definitely very tired but I didn't feel like I was going to keel over from exhaustion.

1642103149,Another electrolyte question…,"TL;DR - ongoing issues with electrolytes despite adequate intake as per guidelines. Is over 8000mg sodium normal?

I’ll start by saying I have read the FAQ as well as using the search feature extensively trying to get my head around this.

I have done Keto and IF on and off for the past couple of years. I have been back on Keto for about a week now and having ongoing issues with what I presume to be electrolytes. It seems that I am very sensitive when it comes to getting the correct balance and can’t seem to stop the symptoms of electrolyte imbalance no matter what I do.

I’m F/25/5”7/163lbs and I go to the gym and walk 30-60 mins 4 times per week. Other than that I am mostly sedentary. I track everything meticulously and according to Chronometer, I am getting on average 7000-8000mg sodium, 2000-3000mg potassium and 600mg elemental magnesium from magnesium citrate each day. I also drink between 2.5 and 3.5 litres of liquid total (ketoade, 1 cup of coffee and some plain water). When I go to pee, it is usually a pale yellow colour which would indicate that I am adequately hydrated, despite having slight dry mouth. I am trying to do IF and some fasting because I am generally not hungry but have to eat because of these issues with electrolytes.

I am getting a slight tingling sensation mostly in my right arm/leg and am very aware that my heart is beating at various points in the day. I have tried taking less electrolytes and it just makes it worse - I have had a couple of evenings with full on heart palpitations, hot and flushing face, numbness etc but that was fixed with more salt. I find that when I supplement more lite salt that it makes the symptoms somewhat worse, but I don’t know if it’s just placebo because I have read horror stories on this sub about supplementing potassium.

I guess my question is, do I need even more electrolytes? I do two batches of Ketoade per day (1/2 tsp salt, 1/4 lite salt in each) and make sure to get most of my potassium from food cos lite salt kinda scares me. I eat things such as broccoli, zucchini, mushrooms, plenty of meat, butter, cheese, bacon, eggs. 8000mg sodium seems a lot already, surely I don’t need more? I don’t have these issues when not on Keto. 

Does anyone else have to consume a crazy amount of salt? Can I expect this to get better with time? It’s such a hassle having to balance things SO meticulously and it’s distracting me from my daily life.

[https://i.imgur.com/waPt87X.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/waPt87X.jpg)  


Id like to share a few things I've learned this year in hopes that maybe someone reading them can take something from it. Remember everyone is different, but these are my thoughts.   


Quit listening to others when they doubt what you are doing diet wise. I've had my fair share of people trashing on the keto lifestyle. ""You are going to give yourself a heart attack, THINK OF YOUR CHOLESTEROL"", ""There is no way you can think this is a long term diet solution"". Blah blah blah, those same people have asked me for more information about the keto diet once they saw my success. QUIT GIVING A SHIT WHAT THEY SAY. Progress will eventually shut them all up. (or at least make them go away).   


Goals are meant to be replaced with new goals, this has kept me motivated. Originally I sat out to get down to 250 thinking this would be a good weight for me. 250 turned into 225, turned into 215, turned into sub 200. Don't get complacent, don't be satisfied, whether a goal is to maintain that weight, or lose more, or build muscle. WHATEVER the case maybe, keep the ending just out of reach to keep you motivated.   


Get yourself a smart scale, and take progress pictures. I didn't get my scale until March, and I didn't take a full body photo until around that time as well. I regret it because a timeline would of made progress a hell of a lot easier to track for me. You see yourself everyday, 15-20 pounds is not something you will notice as you are going along. But I guarantee you will notice if you can see it side by side. It's also super nice to have a scale that tracks history, looking at those weight charts reminds you its okay to gain a little weight here and there and its completely normal!  


If you screw up and knock yourself out of ketosis IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD. Say this out loud! I've knocked myself out of ketosis more times than I can remember, and you know what TOMORROW IS A NEW DAY. Pick back up, don't dwell on it just keep moving forward. Mistakes happen, it'll be just fine.   


There have been weeks i've put on 4-10 pounds by what the scale tells me. Putting on weight, staying the same weight, is just as frequent now as losing pounds. Don't fret a small chunk of time, look at the big picture. This is in no way a linear process.

1642129036,Advice for Carb Withdrawals,"Hey all! I just discovered this Reddit but I've been doing keto for years. Started in 2014, managed to mostly keep with it, and finally went a full year without any refined sugar or artificial sweeteners. I've also become something of a guru in my family and social circles since everyone can see how healthy and skinny I am now.

When I started keto I didn't really want to ""diet."" I just wanted to stop my sugar addiction. Studies show sugar affects the same part of your brain that cocaine does. So I went cold turkey without white sugar, focusing on meats and a few veggies.

As I think anyone who's tried giving up sugar can attest, the consequences hit hard. I would struggle through days like wading in pea soup. But I found something moderately helpful.

If you do a quick Google search on ""cocaine withdrawal chart"" you can find a number of little infographics that show what to expect week by week. Cocaine is much harsher than sugar obviously, but it goes to reason that if sugar has a similar effect to cocaine on your brain, the withdrawals may be similar too.

I like the AddictionBlog chart but there's a number of them in images. It'll show you that week one you can expect to be hungry, restless, etc... then week two you may get an increased appetite, agitation, vivid dreams... 

As I suffered my initial symptoms it was very helpful to have a road map of what to expect next. So when I'd have a random angry outburst or vivid dream I could look at the chart and recognize that it was just the withdrawals. 

In no way am I trying to compare sugar addiction to cocaine addiction. The latter is definitely more difficult than the former. The chart does not perfectly match up, but in my experience it is a reasonably comparable guideline.

Last Monday I got sick. Fever, chills, muscle aches, the works. A few days later I start feeling constantly nauseous and having bad stomach troubles. Well, turns out I had a bad stomach bug.

So a few more days go by and I don’t feel that much better. I go to the doctor in case I needed fluids (which I did not get so I guess I didn’t need them?), but I still feel shitty. At that point I call my pediatrician and left a message about what’s going on. A nurse calls me back and tells me that I likely have high ketone levels, and that I need to suck on a popsicle.

I was confused and at this point I’m very scared (I have GAD, the sick made it way worse). After research I figured out that my body is in ketosis. I’ve gotten a lot better but I’ve still got some mild symptoms of that “keto flu”. See, normally I’m a huge foodie. When I got sick I completely lost my appetite. I probably fasted on accident, and now my body is in ketosis. I don’t like the way it makes me feel, so I’m coming here to ask for any advice.

Just write down what it was that you had and the approximate quantity. You will find that being more aware of what you are eating helps you to plan healthy meals and snacks.  
2. Limit treats containing sugar to three times per week. This includes chocolate, ice cream, desserts, cake, pastries, cookies, etc. 

3. Include a lower fat source of protein at most meals: chicken, fish, beans, cottage cheese, or low fat yogurt. Have eggs, nuts and red meat occasionally but not every day.

4. Plan at least one lunch and dinner every week without meat or cheese. Build those meals around whole grains, vegetables and beans to increase fiber and reduce fat. 

5. Reduce the fat content in your milk products. If you are currently drinking whole milk, reduce to 2% fat. From 2% reduce to 1%. Choose lower fat cheese and yogurt. When you buy yogurt, also check that it does not contain sugar.",True,1,1.0,0,Shankar0093,False,False,keto

1642178641,1st Coronary Calcium Score Result - 9 years Low Carb - LDL hyper-responder,"Hi

Some chronic muscle cramps deep in my upper back lead me to consult a cardiologist.  The CAC score came back as  0 - Zero.

&amp;#x200B;

Some facts from the last 9 years:

&amp;#x200B;

* Always between full Keto (&lt;50g)  and low carb (\~100g) since 2013. 
* Last 1.5 years were low carb (\~100g) to gain weight (+8kg). 
* \&gt;90% of diet with unprocessed foods (pork, beef, fish, animal products, some veggies, some legumes, some seeds, water, nuts)
* Processed foods were mostly some greek yogurt, whole linseed bread slices, some frozen fish sticks, very very rarely some pizza, oilive oil, coconut water.
* Carbs source was varied. This past 1.5 year: Sweet potato, sometimes brown rice, sometimes white rice, sometimes linseed bread, coconut water.  Other years: residual carbs from foods, veggies etc.
* Fats source was mostly from meats and fish, butter and recently coconut oil.
* Supplements: Multi vitamin and table spoon full of sea salt, Omega3, Magnesium Vit-D. This past year I added BCAA's. Curcumin+Peperin+ginger.   Some months of the last few years I do Vit K2 (mk7 + mk4)      
* Last Cholesterol readings date from 1 year ago.  330 Total, HDL in the 60's. Triglycerides 70's.
* Zero exercise. No sports or gym or any form of cardio. 
* No alcohol, no coffee, no smoking. 
* My weight was low for my height for 7 of those 9 years. Increasing carbs to \~100g in the past 1.5 years gained me 8Kg of weight with at least half of it being fat (!!!).

&amp;#x200B;

What i've learned: Ketosis isn't mandatory. Carbs seem to be OK up to a point depending on the source. Most importantly it seems to be the avoidance of processed foods and vegetal oils. For 99% of my meals I absolutely avoided  vegetal oils like the plague.

This is my second attempt at keto and both times starting around 10 weeks I begin to feel weakness and fatigue. Walking with a cane and hugging the walls kinda weakness while I spend 90% of the time in bed (I'm lucky enough to have someone take care of me).

The first time I ended up at the ER twice. The first time they said I was dehydrated, so I began suppliementing. The second time they couldn't find anything wrong. This progressed for 2 months without getting better before I quit. 

Now I'm back at it because I can't go on at this weight and keto is the only way I've ever been able to not succumb to sugar addiction at the first sign of caloric deficit. That first month and a half is so empowering I can't imagine wanting to life any other way. But I'm quickly heading back to the point where I can't live my life anymore.

Suppliementing doesn't help. Eating more fat doesn't help. Maintaining weight doesn't help.
The only thing I've found that helps is eating over 100g of carbs everyday but that isn't triggers the sugar addiction and I can't sustain it.

My diet consists of mostly

Meat: beef, pork, chicken, shrimp,

Veggies: zucchini, green peppers, califlower, broccoli, lettuce, spinach, olives, pickles (and pickle juice), turnip, avacadoe, onions (very sparingly)

Cheese, cream, oils (olive, coconut, avacadoe, MCT) , eggs, almond and coconut flour, psyllium husk powder

Small amounts of blueberries and raspberries which I have with cream or in those slimfast keto shakes.

Sweeteners: stevia, erythritol, munkfruit and a tiny bit of xyolital while I use up what I have left

Salt!

It's not a good long term diet plan and ffs any diet that basically says you can take half a pound of bacon, slather it in mayonnaise, and eat it for lunch, but you can't eat an apple because the apple has carbs, probably isn't actually a good diet! Your body needs carbs. 

YOUR  BODY  NEEDS  CARBS 

It's a stupid diet! cutting carbs down, yes, eating healthier carbs, yes! Cutting them out completely?! NO! Cutting out carbs can lead to detrimental effects on your body! Not to mention you will likely reduce your energy levels severely, there could be nutrient deficiencies, and they can affect your brain, causing memory issues and also affect thinking.

Long term keto diet will make you cranky, tired, brain foggy, could harm your organs, and a litany of other things. Oh, and all the weight you'll lose? When you eventually go back to a normal diet, chances are the weight will come back!""

I have been mentally preparing myself for this keto thing for a few weeks now. If I go I’m going all in- no cheat days or anything like that. My question is the carb intake. I know it’s about 50 grams a day. I have read in a few places that there are bad carbs that do nothing for you but then there are good carbs that you can eat a lot more of like the carbs from vegetables.

1642225084,I’m hiding my keto diet from my family and it’s hard.,"The first time I(23F, CW 157lb GW 115lb) did keto was in early 2020. My fam was happy and everyone was on board and my older sisters even gave me some money for groceries because I’m a broke college student and usually couldn’t afford to eat fresh meats and veggies every day. The thing is I failed. I didn’t have a plan and quit everything cold turkey and I ultimately caved and ate a mass amount of carbs because I was frustrated. I quit the diet. 

The thing is my family guilted me so much after that. They’d constantly bring up how I can’t stick to anything and don’t care about my health (I very much do care) and how I wasted money and whatever. It went on for months and it sucked. 

This is take two of keto. I really, really want to do well this time and spent a while working on my relationships with food, portions, sugar, exercise, and carbs so that when I started it wouldn’t feel like such a jolt. It’s only been a week but I feel way better than the first time I tried it. The thing is I just don’t want to deal with another half year of guilt trips if I fail again, so I didn’t tell anyone this time except my bf, who supports me wholeheartedly. 

It’s becoming increasingly difficult to hide now. Whenever my family calls (I live in my college town far away) they’ll ask what I ate and then be like ‘you ate chicken wings again?’ or ‘more fried fish, really?’ or ‘so much cheese?’ or whatever. It’s frustrating because I know those things are all ok on keto and they’re how I’m dieting, but I’m getting yelled at for things I know are diet-friendly. They don’t care that I don’t eat sugar or desserts or bowls of pasta or mounds of rice or whatever. They only care that I’m eating meats a lot for some reason. 

If I tell them I’m on keto, I risk months of guilting if I fail again. If I don’t, I deal with constant lectures about my diet. I’m at an impasse and honestly just so tired of this. I’m putting a lot of effort into this and I just want to diet in peace.",True,1,1.0,0,anamsj1218,False,False,keto

However, this night, I woke up around 3 a.m. and couldn't sleep back because I felt extremely hungry and a bit sweaty. I used to experience this sometimes when I ate a high carb dinner and I have read that it is due to my blood sugar dropping low. (I have insulin resistance, so my blood sugar used to fluctuate a lot, including dropping extremely low after 1-2 hours of a high carb meal, or simply in the middle of the night.) In the past, I used to binge eat at 3 a.m. when this happened, and then I slept like a baby (but woke up in the morning with a stomach ache and extreme bloating). However, this night I refused eating and instead took an extra bit of sodium, potassium and magnesium. I also opened the window for some fresh air and walked a bit up and down. Then in 30 minutes, I was sleepy again and could go back to sleep and woke up in the morning refreshed and with energy to do stuff.

My question is, could I have electrolyte deficiency even if I intake the electrolyte values recommended by the faq? Is this why I feel so weak and hungry and sleep badly?

1642241990,How to not Overeat Nuts,"Hi guys,

I've discovered a trick that might be of use to you.

One of the reasons keto is so effective is the it eliminates hyper-palatable and bingeable foods. 

One exception to that is nuts. I could easily binge on them which is a big problem because they're insanely calorie dense (think 500-700 calories per 100g!!).

I read somewhere that non-roasted nuts are less fattening because the body's absorption of their calories is significantly lower than their roasted counterparts; so, I thought I'd by some non-roasted nuts for that reason alone.

What I discovered was that the binging went away and those nuts lasted a very long time! They are just not nearly as delicious as salted &amp; roasted so it's very easy to eat just a handful as a healthy keto-friendly snack.

What made me write this post is that the last time I ordered nuts I though ""hey what the heck I'm doing fine diet-wise so I deserve a bit of some enjoyable snacks"".... BIG MISTAKE. Yesterday I ate 3,000 calories worth of nuts! I think I'll give the rest to my skinny brother and hopefully never repeat that mistake.

Anyways, before I talk to the doctor again I want to have a game plan but I'm honestly not well versed in cholesterol. 

My usual daily eating habits are
Breakfast: 2 eggs and frozen sausage patty (no additional oil, just cook sausage first), black coffee
Lunch: spinach, ranch dressing and chicken salad
Dinner: 80/20 burger patty, mayo, keto bread/high fiber tortilla.
Snacks (varies between): avocado, meat sticks/sausage, mio water flavorings, almonds, cheese, Gatorade zero.

1642254123,"Keto ""Full"" just hits different","Happy new year everyone -

&amp;#x200B;

after having some major hiccups during the holidays, being a few weeks back into keto makes me not ever wanna take this for granted again. I was eating 1000s upon 1000s of calories of garbage and never feeling good (surprise to no one lol) but the crazy thing to me is how good the keto ""full"" feels.

Prior to keto I could just eat all the time and I thought full was getting to the point of sick and having to lay down. With keto + OMAD like i've been doing this year, a 16 oz steak with some broccoli and eggs not only keeps me full until the next day, the full just feels amazing. I don't feel like laying down, or thinking about food again, I just feel content and giving my body energy to go on about my day.

Anyone else feel this way? Even when eating the ""healthier"" carbs like brown rice etc with some protein, I never felt this comfortable satiated full. Maybe because I was always overeating and not recognizing it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Just feeling amazing and wanted to share today &lt;3

1642258817,Keto Potato Chips (Eat with No Guilt),"This chips recipe is completely keto friendly and gluten-free with no flour or starch used. It is also a good source of protein as it is made with almond flour and whey protein. These chips are great snacks for parties or during festive season. Extend your creativity by pairing them with dips of your liking, e.g., cheese dips, salsa dips.

We are missing potato chips a lot, even more frustrating when experimenting different recipes which do not give me that kind of crunchy crackling sound when I'm expecting them to be. If you miss crunchy chips, this is for you. It tastes just like potatoes when there is no seasoning. It tastes even more like store bought potato chips after adding in simple homemade MSG free seasonings.

This recipe yield two trays of chips, depending how thin you can slice them. The thinner you can slice it, the crunchier the chips get. I do not have any slicer at home. But worth to give it a try so long the dough has been hardened well by freezing it before slicing it.

**Ingredients**

* 75g almond flour
* 24g whey protein
* 5g monk fruit sweetener, or any sweetener of choice
* 2g baking powder
* 1.5g xanthan gum
* 1 tsp avocado oil (or any neutral oil of choice)
* 30ml warm or hot water (both would work)
* Pinch of salt (omit this if you use seasoning below)

**Seasoning (optional)**

* 1/2 to 1 tsp salt
* 1/4 tsp onion powder
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder

**Method**

1. Mix all dry ingredients together.
2. Add in avocado oil and warm/hot water.
3. Knead the dough with palm and shape it into a cylinder. The mixture will be sticky. But that's the consistency we are looking for.
4. Steam it at the steamer for 25 mins. The skewer should come out clean when poke through the center.
5. Freeze the steamed dough for 1 hour before slicing.
6. Bake it at 170°C for 8 mins. Depending on your oven, if it is browning to fast, you can cover the top by using aluminium foil.

However, the label also lists 8g of Erythritol per serving.

I am a small person. A 5’0 tall, small boned female, about 15-20 lbs overweight in my 50’s. Post menopausal. Prior to starting Keto I had a terrible diet, sometimes devouring an entire box of cookies in a day- along with a heavy soda habit (regular Coke) and along with my regular diet of meat, vegetables and starches and lots of desserts. I love baking and desserts. I can put away an unbelievable amount of food for my size. Severe sweet tooth. 

I started Keto on a Saturday. I restricted my carbs to under 20 grams each day. The first 2 days I was optimistic and feeling fine. By day 3, Keto flu hit me hard. After day 3 I was barely able to function. I was having strong heart palpitations, sweating, and feeling incredibly light headed. I was eating eggs, cheese, sour cream, avocados, heavy cream, ground beef, and had a small green salad here and there. I was always hungry. One night I ate an entire package of Boursin cheese like pudding out of sheer desperation. I was never fully satiated and always hungry. 

By day 4 I was incapacitated and day 5 I fainted. My husband insisted I drink a small amount of coke and eat a 4 piece chicken strip box from Chick-fil-A which I did and immediately started feeling better within hours.

I am tough. I can withstand pain and uncomfortableness, but the heart palpitations and fainting where too much. I was scared. After three days on Keto, the world would spin if I sat up. 

I’d like to try Keto again, but don’t know how. Should I ease into it by cutting carbs down to under 100 grams? 50? I don’t understand what happened to me as I have been able to withstand the Keto flu in the past. Any advice? Thank you!",True,1,1.0,0,Environmental-Ad9339,False,False,keto

As of last year I found research pointing to a few ways to help improve my symptoms and over time possibly put the condition in remission. Out of the changes I've made adding some aspects of keto to my dietary rotation eas one.  Full keto would be a good idea for my health in theory.  Knowing myself and my personal limitations makes that impossible in practice because I couldn't stick with it. One of my biggest weaknesses is starches like bread,  cereals,  rice,  and pasta which are full of carbs.  Also I have a major sweet tooth that I've been slowly finding healthy alternatives to so I'm curbing that. My recent healthy alternative wasn't keto friendly because it has cheerios,  corn flakes,  or bran flakes mixed with home made plain yogurt,  raisons and or fresh berries,  pecans,  and stevia or eyrithritol as a swetener.  Yesterday I ran out of the cereal,  and today I got in some amaranth I bought online to use for food and to grow more food because it's seeds are edible as is the rest of the plant. The seeds are classified as either a seed or a psuedo grain.  The Aztecs and myans used them for flour and making polenta kind of things.  It can be used to make a gluten free version of hoe cakes and the like. I know pretty much any food with gluten is high in carbs. Today I made a porridge with it with cinnamon and ginger and sweetener then added the yogurt,  blueberries,  and pecans. I know most of that is pretty keto friendly,  I'm not sure on the amarnath though.  If it is,  it would be a keto friendly healthy way to curb my sweet tooth. I'm not a fan of chia or flax seeds,  but this tastes pretty good and is classified similar.  The bag it came in doesn't state a carb content A-side from fiber and states no other kinds of sugars either.  So on that front I'm not sure.

1642341270,Too impatient or doing something wrong?,"TL;DR: After two weeks of what I consider a very strict keto diet, I did not experience any significant weight loss. Is this time frame too short for starting to lose weight, or am I doing something wrong?

I am using the breath analyzer ""Ketoscan"" daily for measuring my breath Acetone level. This product seems to be the most reliable under the non-clinical products. The acetone level fluctuates between 5 and 14ppm, with an average of around 9-10ppm. According to the app, this is within the keto sweet spot. This is a good indication that my body has been in a constant state of ketosis for the last 10 days or so.

The app also reports that at my level of ketosis, my body should get rid of 4-7g of fat *per hour*. This would be something like a half or one bar of chocolate in weight per day, or around 3-5kg per month. Of course, this is just the app taking an educated guess.

My bodyweight dropped by 1kg right at the onset of the ketosis, and has since remained stable for about a week. I am measuring every day now, which I want to reduce drastically after the first ""keto success"".

My diet ist mostly based on two keto cookbooks. For the time being, I use the recipes that are heavy on meat, because this is a good way for me to stay motivated and away from sugar. On the long run, I want to reduce the amount of meat, but only when staying keto has stabilized for me. For now, eating high-quality meat is a good way to ""lure"" myself into this new way of eating. My intention is to stay keto for the rest of my life.

When I snack, I use either cheap salt-rich snack sausages or Gouda cheese. I recently started to try out some cheeses with a richer flavor. I also make myself Mozarella with cheese sometimes, which I love.

I successfully stay away from sugary or other non-keto snacks or drinks. I consume alcohol only very, very seldom. Hasn't happened in the last two weeks. I only drink water at the moment.

My level of physical activity is *much* too low on most days. I am working from home office like most people probably are currently, and I don't take a walk every day. Occasionally, I will go out for a walk, and then I take around 4k-6k steps. Sometimes more, when I walk with someone else. But definitely not daily. More like once or twice per week.

So my question is: Should I give my body some more time to accommodate? Am I too impatient expecting even a moderate weight loss after two weeks? Or is the lack of weight loss a sign that I am doing something wrong?

Some more details, in case you want to know:

* I use MCT oil instead of other oils frequently.
* My level and quality of sleep is very unsatisfying at the moment. I will often not get enough sleep.
* I have absolutely no idea or consideration about protein in my diet.
* My job and hobby are both very ""brainy"", i.e. my brain definitely needs those sweet sweet ketones in order to work.",True,1,1.0,1,Madoc_eu,False,False,keto

I also do strength training and take creatine, in case this is a matter of muscle gain or water retention.

1642348172,High BUN,"Hi guys,

I had been GAPs/ketogenic for 7 months for my autoimmune disease.  Realizing I was still reacting to different foods, I just decided to go straight carnivore 14 days ago.  


A few days ago I got some test results which showed my creatinine a bit high (1.30. It normally averages like 1.1-1.2 for the past 10y), but my BUN was 30!  I've never had a BUN reading over 20, and its normally like 16.

  
My questions are:  


1.)  Did carnivore do this?  I assume that it did...since BUN measures nitrogen from urea breakdown, and urea is product of protein consumption?  


2.)  Does the increased BUN indicate some sort of kidney damage is happening, or only that the normal ranges they cite for BUN arent accurate for someone on carnivore (i.e. if i eat a lot of protein my BUN will be higher even if my kidneys are working fine)?  


3.)  Will this eventually settle down?  


I’ve asked in the carnivore group too but no one responded.  Any insight appreciated.

1642356563,Been doing IF for 7 years &amp; Doctor just told me I’m prediabetic &amp; recommended Keto.,"First post here and pretty new to Keto.  I have a bachelors in health and wellness so familiar with the diet itself but never imagined I’d be doing it.  

TLDR: just started keto for health reasons, stressful and busy life. Looking for tips to build a longer life style of low carbs / keto.  

Context: 
I weigh 177 - 6’2.  Male. 
I used to be a marathon runner, had a fall rock climbing in 2012 and injured my back so stopped running. Been doing mountain biking the past 2 years &amp; am in relatively decent shape.  Genetics play quite a big role in my family for predisposition to diabetes type 1.  Recently got a blood glucose monitor and test in the 103-110 range in the morning after at least a 10-12 hour fast.   
I started IF in 2015 after listening to a Rhonda Patrick podcast on Tim Ferris show.  I start eating at 12-1 in the afternoon and typically am done by 8pm.  
I have a super high stress job - running two ecommerce businesses.


Doctor recommended keto and IF, I told them I’ve been doing IF for a while and would give keto a shot.  


Started by eliminating white carbs / breads.  Went a couple weeks pretty hard core &amp; blood glucose dropped to the high 94-99 range in the morning. Christmas and New Years I cheated a bunch and now back in the same original zone I was before starting - despite keeping a reduced carb intake by at least 70%.  


In college I remember reading that keeping a keto (low carb) diet forever is really tough &amp; that it’s best to find a balance where you are less likely to rebound and binge on carbs. 


Not really sure where to go, what to do and how to maintain full keto.  I have 2 small children whose diets consist of lots of pasta and cereal - and I’m basically cooking 2 meals in the evening which doesn’t seem super sustainable. Meanwhile being bombarded with keto meal delivery ads.  


Any tips for a newb?  

Usually skip breakfast and pound black coffee in the morning.  
Lunch I have roughly 15-30 mins of time working from home.  
Dinners are rushed with managing kids

2. How do I get good advice on interpretation?

That tool helped drive her to eat more protein and healthy fats, and go to the gym four or five days a week.

Keto (I now refuse to lump it in with fad ""diets"") has brought me health, a vastly improved sense of self, and improved overall willpower. 

I wanted to talk about a huge side benefit.

**Fair Warning**: If poop talk bothers you, exit now. 

I'm a colon cancer survivor, going on 8 years now. So, I'm missing about 18 inches of colon. I'm not certain if that plays into what happens to me, but I think maybe yes.

In short: when I consume a lot of sugar and/or carbs, I pay for it on the shitter in ways most people can't even imagine. I literally shit through the eye of a needle for a full day, with as many as 10-12 trips to the loo for a whole day until it's out of my system.

It's way, way worse than a hangover. And I've had my share of those in the past. 

Conversely, when I eat strict keto, none of that happens. Normal, truly healthy and regular BMs are the rule. And, added bonus, I virtually never, ever have any gas, which my wife will tell you isn't the case when I'm off keto.

1642448953,How do I improve my Müsli (Cereal)?,"Hi there,

I have just started the Keto journey and I have encountered a question that I was not able to answer.

Due to doing IF for a long time, I usually skip breakfast and eat Müsli (german cereal) every day at noon.

This is what it looked like before starting Keto:  


Few tablespoons Müsli (oats, soy flakes, amaranth, quinoa, flaxseed, coconut flakes, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds - definitely not low carb)

200ml milk (7oz)  
1 heaped tablespoon Quark (german curd, kind of like philadelphia brand cream cheese, but without fat)

Few tablespoons yoghurt

1 Apple, 1 Banana

&amp;#x200B;

Now, given that the above is high in carbs and therfore not keto, I have come up with the following:

&amp;#x200B;

100g Keto-Müsli (coconut flakes, pecan, walnut, flaxseed, almonds, brazil nuts, chia seeds etc. - quite low carb at 4g total carbs per 100g)

200ml (7oz) coconut or almond ""drink"" (Alpro brand, no carbs)

100g yoghurt (greek style, 3.4g total carbs per 100g)

50-100g frozen raspberries/strawberries (vitamins and to give it some taste/colour)

&amp;#x200B;

Do you think there is a way to make it even more low-carb without taking away nutritional value?

I have thought about diluting coconut milk with water instead of buying the expensive coconut drink which basically has the same ingredients. But that does not do much regarding carbs, it's just cheaper.

I took the ""after"" pic last week and couldn't believe the difference. This before pic was well into my keto journey but before I decided to come up with any real goals. At that point, I was just happy to not be obese anymore and chugging along, cheating here and there, but still unclear on where I wanted to be. I had some self-limiting deeply held beliefs that I couldn't get to where I really wanted to go and wouldn't even admit to myself fully how I wanted to look and feel. I don't think I even owned a scale at this point, I was just tracking my clothing sizes.

I admitted to myself some time into my journey that I really wanted to be a milf**\*\*\***. I was working in a law firm with some very powerful women attorneys who were fit and formidable. They owned their depositions without an ounce of fear. I looked up to them so much and knew I wanted to be like them in so many ways, including physically. They were around ten years older than me, but in much better shape than me. 

After I admitted this to myself I started to believe I could do it. I started calling myself a milf. I started saying how I wanted to be milfy. Just saying this and thinking it over and over as turned into mantra or affirmation and changed my beliefs. I didn't do this intentionally, I just wanted it so bad, I said it a lot.

With  my new beliefs I was able to lose so much weight and start to tone up. Now when I exercise, I feel so happy and invigorated I have to remind myself to take a breather in between sets instead of dancing around to my music and not catching my breath. 

I want you to know I am a very lazy person and also kind of set in my ways. I still refuse to count calories and I didn't come up with a workout routine, I outsourced a trainer and now do his workout plan on my own. I refused to work out until my body was asking for me to. I don't like being out of breath or exhausted or to feel clumsy or weak, so I mainly did walking until I got small enough where lifting just feels good to me, not hard. When I get to the point that I need more, I will incorporate yoga because I am on a spiritual journey now too.

As far as the soup, I don't know how many carbs are actually in it, and personally I don't look with a magnifying glass. I am still losing weight while not tracking macros or anything. This is just the way I do it, it's more intuitive for me and listening to my body. If I'm not hungry I don't eat. If I am ravenous I eat more. My hormonal cycle is at play with this, so I lean into it. 

My goal is to reach 142 which would be a 100lb weight loss total. I am almost there! 

**\*\*\****At the time I didn't know the pornographic implications of this, I just meant a hot mom who is fit and toned, active &amp; bubbly.

Due to this, I gained a lot of weight. I got to 295 then dropped to 285 after graduating, but lately I been watching my carbs and working out. Its been a month. I've been eating close to 60 carbs a day and mostly eat protein. I don't think I even meet all of my calorie requirements. and I go to the gym 3-4 times a week. I do inclined cardio on 12X at 1.7-2.0 speed, and for a 45 min workout, I burn close to 300 calories. before, I used to eat an unlimited amount of carbs a day, but since Ive been watching them for the last month, and eating healthy, I figured my weight would drop anyway regardless of activity, but my weight isn't dropping as fast as it used to, when I've lost weight before. By eating all protein in the past, I would easily lose weight, but now im losing wight a lot slower. Im down to 279 but for 1 month, 6 pounds can't be right. Does anyone have advice or anything helpful for me? Some people have mentioned that its possible Im losing fat but not weight, but how would one even determine that?

1642472624,Are there any other picky eaters on Keto struggling?,"I have done keto a year in total with huge success. I went from 170 to 135 pounds in ~6 months. I gained 10 pounds over the holidays and am trying to get down to 120/125. 

Last time I did keto I mainly relied on Atkins products (bars, shakes, so on). Now I learned now bad malitol is and am avoiding it at all cost. Whenever I go on keto I get very obsessive over carbs (like I think everyone does aha). I started keto again pretty much on the new year (I think? maybe the week after?) and have only lost 4 pounds. 

I know a big reason for this is because I am simply not eating enough. I have 2 meals a day at most and they are very small. Nearly everyday I'll have 6 of those little frozen meatballs for lunch and either 2 burgers for dinner, chicken or something whacky. I am rather young and I know my calorie intake needs to be upped. I'm not eating any snacks (at most 1-2 cheesesticks)

I remember last time I was on keto I started eating a little bit more and my weight dropped almost immediately. BUT my problem right now is I can't find anything that I want to eat to up my intake. Last time I ate more I was eating those like low carb wraps, Atkins snacks, etc. Now I REFUSE to touch anything in fear that they might be sneaking real flour or some really bad product into them. I physically cannot go and eat more even though I know it will benefit me. I am a very picky person, even before keto I would be eating burger subs most of my time (combined with a lot of potatoes), I was big on my cultural foods too like pierogi and assorted soups I cannot eat now :(( However I am going to go pick up some kiełbasa from the deli and that will be a nice treat and maybe help me a bit;)

I only really like beef. The chicken texture grosses me out even though I used to eat it a ton (what if I undercook it? those little blood things that appear in the middle of the chicken makes me stop eating). Those meatballs gross me out too but I just suck it up and eat them as I've done for months. Put enough cheese on it and I'll eat anything ahaha. I have wanted to eat more deli meats like turkey and chicken as I've been craving those like crazy, but my dad said they are way too high in sodium and I should stay away (the price doesn't help either). But I've heard that your sodium should be increased on Keto?? 

Is anyone in the same boat as me? I cannot find something that I genuinely enjoy (well except burgers but I know I *really* should not be eating it as much as I do. I have crazy high cholesterol and been told I should eat more lean shit). I can't trust those keto products.. any of them. But I NEED to up my calorie intake and it's driving me insane.

So,  I made a mix of blended lemon,  lime,  blueberries,  ginger,  and cinnamon with a few drops of acv and 2 stevia packets in some water.  I didn't add more than a tbsp of the blend.  All of that us in an approximately 20oz bottle with filtered water. I'm not on a keto diet at present,  but am lowering my carb intake incrementally and finding heathly subs for unhealthy habits. Things like this are a sub for store bought carbonated flavored water with aspartame. It's not carbonated,  but it's a healthy version of fkavored water.

TLDR version of the above: Restarted Keto from a carb and booze heavy lifestyle for 2022 got ED over night.
After that post I did the following.

1) Made an appointment with my GP Doctor. 
2) Started taking a Vitamin D supplements in the AM.
3) Massively boosted my electrolyte intake. (I was chugging Gatorade zero like it was my job)
4) Tried to relax about the issue but I'm not great at relaxing but I did try.

After 3 days of useing Vitamin D and after I boosted my electrolyte intake the problem seemed to disappear as fast and over night as it came. One morning I just woke up with my usual Morning Wood and haven't had a problem getting it up since. 

I was able to cancel my Doctors appointment since it wasn't for another week and a half anyways but I'll tell her about this at my next general physical in 3 months. 

I don't know what exactly solved my problem but I can say I think I forgot how important electrolytes are when having an ultra low carb diet. Also Vitamin D seems important too.

Also all this might have been just part of a general body confusion/Keto Flu while it remembered to preform ketosis.

1642520933,Basic question on ketosis timing,"Hi, question I can't figure out despite reading the wiki and FAQ:

According to the FAQ it takes about 24 hrs to go into ketosis (some sites say even longer, like several days). Eating a certain amount of carbs at once takes you out of ketosis. Sow hat happens if you take your body out of ketosis but then don't eat any more carbs? Where does it get energy after those carbs are exhausted but before returning to ketosis?

So for example if I go into ketosis, then eat a bagel that takes me out of it, then continue eating nothing but steak.. before my body goes back to ketosis and starts burning fat (presumably 24 hrs later), how is it getting energy after the bagel energy is used up? And is the fat consumed from the steaks not being utilized until returning to ketosis?

1642528218,Please convince me not to quit keto! Weird side effects?!,"I’m a 32 year old guy who has successfully been able to manage my weight by following a keto lifestyle for the majority of the last 6 years.

With the help of less-traditional modalities, I was able to first stick to keto back in 2016 and went from 340 lbs at 6’5 to 260 lbs in the span of 6 months. 

In 2016 I had gotten blood work done both before and after the weight loss. After my first stint with keto, my doctor noted that my LDL levels increased, DHEAS levels increased, and a consistent pain in my side was most likely due to gallstones (he was correct).

I had also experienced a significant keto rash on my neck and face which still persists somewhat to this day (gets worse when I’m in ketosis). Additionally, I experienced significant hair loss which my doctor attributed to the increase in DHEAS. He also pointed me to a study indicating that it has been shown that the keto diet can in fact cause DHEAS levels to increase.

On top of all that, I suffered from severe itching of the anus. Like, insatiable itching day and night. My doctor ruled out pinworms, hemorrhoids, and the like, but we were never able to determine a cause. It ended up going away a short time after the initial weight loss and me reintroducing carbs.

Long story short, I’ve recently started keto again and ALL the symptoms are coming back. 

I’m not sure if I should stick with it.

Although it’s been a great tool to lose weight, I’m not sure my body as a whole agrees with it.

1642542944,Primal Egg Cucumber Juice Weightloss,"Aajonus Vonderplanitz, nutritionist of the Primal Diet has a few protocols that he gives his clients for weight loss. One protocol, which can be applied raw or cooked, I will explain here.

He has his clients drink vegetable juice, and raw eggs. Thats it. Until you lose the weight. The vegetable juice had electrolytes, and will keep your digestion functioning well. The eggs, containing every nutrient in existence, are the easiest to digest food. They fully digest in about 30 minutes. The protein contains all the amino acids, and combined with good raw animal fat, the eggs provide great focus and energy. This also gives the intestines a great break because the egg completely digests at the very beginning of the intestines. 

But, I mean, you could eat hard boiled eggs and drink cucumber juice. You won’t get the benefit of giving the intestines a break. You’ll feel more shitty. Less energy. But you could do it. If you are scared of salmonella or something. 

I’ve never gotten sick off a raw egg. I’ve never met someone in real life who has gotten sick off of a raw egg. Good quality raw eggs though! Straight from the farm, or at least pasture raised. And don’t refrigerate it! You want the bacteria! It helps digestion! Or cook it. Don’t ban me. 

So for making the cucumber juice, a masticating juicer is best. If it is centrifugal, air will stir inside it and damage a lot of the nutrients. Better than no juice though. But you need to make it yourself, with organic cucumbers, and peel them! Very important to peel them. A lot have petroleum wax on them that is toxic. You could dice it, then blend it, then squeeze it through a strainer. You'll probably drink 1-3 cups a day. But a masticating juicer is best. You’ll get a better yield, and a higher quality juice.

Why juice? The fiber overly alkalizes the digestive tract, which prevents the digestion of the raw protein in the egg. It is very hydrating, and you’ll be more hydrated, with less liquids overall.

If you want to drink water, drink naturally carbonated sparkling water. Pellegrino is a brand I trust. Not sponsored. With carbonated water, the carbonation kills any bacteria, so it passes inspections to be sold with no chemicals . Other brands need some chemicals to deem it safe to pass inspection. Naturally carbonated mineral water is the best.

You could squeeze lemon or lime into the water for electrolytes for better hydration. 

Adding raw honey is great. Many brands that say raw, are heated often up to 160, degrees. It has to never go above 93. A majority of the time I get straight from the farmer, it is also heated. How you can tell is, eat it by itself, and if it burns your throat, it has been heated too hot at some point. The only 2 brands of honey I trust are called Really Raw which is in many health food stores, and Y.S. ORGANIC BEE FARMS. USDA ORGANIC 100% CERTIFIED ORGANIC RAW HONEY from Whole Foods in north west Arkansas.. Be really careful with your honey choice. Often, you need to take a picture of all the info of the honey at the store, and go home and email and call all of them and ask about the temperatures, heating, and storing during transportation, etc.

But honey is great. Don’t over do it though. Like 2 tablespoons per 4 ounces of water, with 4 ounces of lime or lemon juice. That is a good sports drink. You could even get raw cream, and crack a raw egg in it. The raw cream will prevent the egg from oxidizing, and provide raw fat, and the egg will give easily digested protein, for focus during whatever you are doing.

I could go into a lot more detail. I think it would have to be for other posts.

In the end:
1-3 cups of vegetable juice
.5-3 cups of mineral water with lemon/lime + honey.
12-60+ up to infinite raw eggs. You can eat as many raw eggs as you want.

Cucumbers must be organic and peeled.

Lemons/limes organic. Hand squeezed, strain seeds

Section for water from We Want to Live, Page 180 
“CARBONATED BEVERAGES AND WATERS: If a label reads “carbonation added” or “carbonated” it means that the carbonation is synthetic. Synthetic carbonation causes radicals and free radicals, resulting in mineral and oxygen deficiencies, sometimes resulting in headaches. If a label reads “naturally carbonated”, or “natural carbonation added” or “naturally sparkling”, the carbonation is natural from the well and highly charged with healthful electrolytes. See page 72.
In combination with unheated honey, naturally carbonated waters relieve most headaches. Naturally carbonated waters help relax adrenal glands. Therefore, if you are an individual with low energy, it would probably be better to drink naturally sparkling water only when needed in a remedy.”
So if you have low energy, don’t drink the carbonation. Just shake the carbonation out.
 
So with the eggs, you can eat as many as you want. If you ever get nauseous, that might be because your body is burning fat that has toxins in it and the toxins are being sent to the stomach to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid. Don’t blame the eggs. Or the chickens are fed toxic feed with stuff like gmo corn, or soy. Chickens are scavengers, aka meat eaterns. A vegetarian diet is the worst diet a chicken could have. Make sure it is at least pasture raised. If an egg made you nauseous, maybe the egg is low quality. To combat that, if you eat the egg with a small bit of raw, unheated, unsalted cheese, the cheese will absorb anything toxic in the egg and prevent any damage. The egg is not the problem. Its the toxic feed, hormones, anything like that, that is given to the chickens. If the chicken is healthy, outside, no medicine, on healthy soil, fed no supplements, just extra bugs, or meat/organ scraps of other butchered animals on the farm. Or kill the predators and feed them to the chickens. That will make them healthy. No medicine. Just food, healthy soil, sunshine, healthy air.

Cheese also absorbs toxins that create nausea. Sometimes your body will break down toxins stored somewhere, and your body decides to send it to the stomach, to be neutralized by the hydrochloric acid to become less toxic, or if its severe, you will vomit those toxins out. Vomit is the strongest form of detox. The bacteria isn’t the problem. It will break down the toxins that are stored in the body from a lofe time of cooked food, and industrial toxins, from all sorts of things.

Whenever you need focus, just eat an egg. In about 15 minutes, you’ll start to get more energy.

This information is not a guideline to follow ir, it is just an example of what some of it would maybe look like. If you want to do it, don’t base it off of this information. Study Aajonus yourself, and do it right. Any problems that people have are always due to lack of understanding, or lack of access to the right foods. There is hundreds of hours of detailed information. There is a lot of condensed information also. But read both of his books. We Want to Live and The Recipe to Living Without Disease, in order to understand how to do it properly. Then you can get the details quoted from Aajonus himself from the help of a telegram group or another subreddit. There is a lot of information. But there are easy simple ways to start.

I would expect 1 lb lost a day, maybe up to 3, depends. If you feel too bad, or detox too hard, you need to eat the raw unsalted cheese, butter, more eggs, cut back on the vegetable juice and water, sip up to a gallon of milk a day

It is very important that you sip all liquids! If you don’t sip, you will piss out most of the nutrients. Your stomach breaks down your food, so that your intestines can digest it. If you chug anything, your intestines cant digest a lot of liquid at one time, because if it tried to, it would turn into a bunch of diarrhea. So a good rule of thumb that Aajonus recommends is about 1 oz per minute max. Or else you’ll piss it out and waste nutrients. 

Everything is better in glass. Anything that ferments in plastic will become toxic. The fermentation is a result of bacteria pre digesting the food. When it ferments in plastic, the bacteria also predigest the plastic, then the food becomes toxic. If its fresh in plastic, usually fine. Plastic wrap has a toxic chemical in it. Even when its in meat packaging. Meat touching paper is also bad. It won’t kill you though. Don’t let it sit for long! Transfer to glass. Same with milk. Transfer milk to glass. Cheese, butter, cream, honey, etc. 

Plastic is ok if its fresh and not too hot or cold. And doesn’t sit for very long. Won’t kill you if you break some of these rules. Some are more dangerous than others.

Can be done safe! The problems isn’t the food. Its the additives, packaging, heating, freezing. Keep your eggs room temperature!

Study Aajonus and base it all of him! Everything I said is based off of Aajonus. 

So how does the weight loss work? If you only eat eggs, you lose a lot of weight. That's what Aajonus says. It is true. Only eat eggs, you’ll lose a bunch of weight. And you drink the cucumber/celery juice when your thirsty, it will also keep your appetite high to eat more eggs. Aajonus recommends to eat a golfball size piece of raw beef whenever you are very hungry, but not angry-hungry. You can just do eggs though. If you aren’t into that, do the same thing , but with hard boiled eggs. But you’ll have more problems If you use pasteurized juice, you’ll have more problems. If you do fruit juice, even if raw, you’ll have more problems and be very emotional.

You really need to study a lot. The diet isn’t what's dangerous . This is just reality. He didn’t make food this way. It’s just how it is. You just have to change your understanding. To people who study diligently, it's all natural.

1642557706,Likely unpopular opinion from a keto cook,"I absolutely love to cook, and I’m not the worst at it. Heck, it’s probably why I was so fat to begin with! 

I would like to say that I really do not agree with the depiction of keto being so limiting. I agree in some ways… No doubt finding restaurants and menu items can be an extremely difficult challenge. But, the same could’ve been said for vegetarians in the U.S about 20 years ago. Even today in some countries it is very difficult to be vegan or vegetarian. On the other side of things, in some countries, like India, it is incredibly EASY to be vegan. I deeply feel that even a basic knowledge of cooking opens up countless doors, especially when it comes to keto. My girlfriend is not doing keto with me, but I’ve made her several keto friendly dishes that have been kept in the rotation. Cheesey cauliflower grits with Cajun shrimp. Miso burgers with green onion on a bed of avocado mash. Tonight was a Buffalo chicken blue cheese bacon salad.

With this in mind I decided to go back on keto and saw immediate success like many do however I have encountered a new problem I haven’t previously faced, Keto rash. Started to notice the typical red marks appearing on my stomach probably a week after I changed my diet and it has only gotten worse from then. After restless nights of trying not to constantly itch it seemed to stop and heal somewhat (itchiness disappeared and started to darken a fair bit however still very noticeable) but a little while after that it has came back with a vengeance. The next thing i noticed is that it started to spread to my sides and a little bit now forming on my right collar bone area. This was cause for concern but the final nail in the coffin is that now I have small red marks now appearing mostly on the left hand side of my face and little bits elsewhere on my face. I’m not sure if this is keto rash as they look different to the ones on my gut (smaller and aren’t raised or itchy) but I’m not willing to take the risk. I’m starting college next week and safe to say I’m not wanting any of that shit on my money maker so gonna have to start eating carbs again I think.

To start, I didn’t have high body fat to begin with, started around 11% on Dec 3rd. Prior to starting I was basically eating whatever I wanted and working out fairly inconsistently (2-3 days a week for like 30-35 minutes). 

Once I switch to keto I changed my workout routine and went 6-7 days a week and minimized net carbs to &lt;35g per day. Protein consumption was about 1.5g per lb, operating at a 400-500 daily caloric deficit. As of 4 days ago, My percent body fat was 7.1% according to inbody (which can be inaccurate) and i’ve lost around 1.7 lbs of muscle. I’ve made sure to stay well hydrated the entire time.

I think it was pretty astounding I could minimize muscle loss by working out along with a fairly strong caloric deficit. My plan now is to be in caloric surplus and bulk, and then in a few months jump back into keto and continue working out. Its certainly much easier to gain muscle in a large surplus, I just physically couldn’t eat enough food in keto to get over 1600 calories per day because it’s so satiating. 

Notes: 
- Due to caloric deficit, I limited cardio to one day a week (stationary bike) which is done in tandem with leg day

- While inbody reported net muscle loss throughout the process, nervous system improvements still occurred and I’m lifting between 4-8% heavier weight than before I started, depending on the exercise (I assume it was nervous system improvements)

I’m sort of experimenting, doing a lot of research and sort of guessing along the way, so I really wanted to hear all of your thoughts. This has been a pretty cool experience and I’m definitely coming back to the keto life in the near future.

One last thing, something I noticed while on keto: I don’t get that rough/fuzzy feeling when running my tongue across my teeth at the end of the day. I haven’t really read anything about this, but I assume by replacing carbs with meats and veggies there wasn’t really anything that stuck around in my mouth anymore.

I have a healthy BMI and I plan on losing around 10kg. Please note that this is within my healthy range of weight, nothing wrong about it. The problem is that because I am a smaller person my macros are very tight too. I can consume up to 1156 kcal per day, which is quite hard. When preparing my plan it seems to me that my best bet to eat properly three meals is to make my lunch and dinner just a piece of meat and a very basic salad (no oil or butter) ..adding fats is almost impossible since it makes the kcal macros go above the limit. And forget about any fat bombs, snacks, smoothies, etc.

I feel very frustrated because one of the reasons I chose keto as my diet is because I love food and I don’t want to starve while losing weight but I feel like I don’t enjoy food and I keep thinking about it because I’m constantly hungry (since I’m not having much fats). Could it be that keto to lose weight is more appropriate if you are a bigger person or classified as clinically obese? In those cases I assume your macros are higher and you have more room for tasty meals full of fats, snacks, fat bombs etc… is anyone here a small person trying to lose weight too and struggling like me?

1642667228,"My keto insight so far, and clearing some misconceptions from my own early understanding.","Guys, I see a lot of posts here asking if something is keto or not, but I just want you to ask yourselves why you're doing keto in the first place.

&amp;#x200B;

If you're in it to just lose your current weight, then yes, your paranoia checks out and you'll want to know the carbs in everything.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't speak for everyone, but keto is a chance for me to adapt a better lifestyle and instill a sense of discipline. That I care about what I'm eating. That I want to respect what goes in, so I can use the food instead of just consuming it.

&amp;#x200B;

Contrary to popular belief, carbs aren't evil. They are fuel. A lot of us that have gained weight have not paid attention to how much carbs cared or us over the years, hence our own neglection turned into fats.

&amp;#x200B;

But when you turned to keto, you welcomed that past self (and mistakes) back. You took the decision to own up to shortcoming by turning over a new leaf. To not just eat better, but to understand what you're doing to your body.

&amp;#x200B;

This diet isn't just about carbs bad and keto good. What are you going to do in the long term? Are you going to avoid carbs forever, depriving yourself of healthy fruits and vegetables?

&amp;#x200B;

If you're looking for shortcuts such as zero calories or keto friendly foods, you're just escaping back to the very lifestyle you aimed on cleansing away. Because once keto is over, you'll give into those same urges and cravings and gain it all back. If you're looking for shortcuts now, you'll do so forever.

&amp;#x200B;

And it's okay to take it easy too. Keto isn't an end all be all, it's a system to be better, and that means some time off too. Keto works for me, but sometimes my body tells me after a few week that it needs carbs, which I have fuel intention to burn away the next day.

&amp;#x200B;

If you've been doing keto for a long time now, and you feel off at times, stick to keto but add some carbs because your body will understand what's going on and what it needs, just don't cross the calories and you'll burn away the carbs with some slight effort anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

My main message here is that keto is a message, it's a catalyst and blessing you can use to train yourself to push yourself to where you really want to be.

&amp;#x200B;

My question is, will this put my body in some sort of shock and make me gain like crazy?

1642698652,Carbs are my Drug of Choice – My Keto &amp; Relapse Journey,"Hello Keto friends - I want to preface my Keto journey with some background:

Ever since I was a little kid, I have always struggled with weight. Growing up, I was always 20 pounds overweight. I was never obese, I was just always a kid that had a few extra pounds that “eventually I would grow into”. By my first year in High School, I grew to 6’4, but was still heavy. I played high school varsity sports and my weight was always masked by my athletic ability. I was always that player that if I lost a few pounds, I would be even better kind of deal. Went to College and did college things as a young man would, while slowly creeping on additional weight. Started my working career in an office setting in finance and again, more weight slowly began creeping on until I was 50-60 pounds overweight. After many failed diets and gym memberships – I accepted the fact that I would just always be the tall, big guy and my relationship with food will always be the same. This is my story on my epiphany that **carbs are my drug of choice**:

**January 2020** – Keto was becoming more popular and mainstream. I saw amazing success stories of people losing 400+ pounds on Keto. Even some co-workers around me were on Keto and telling me about their amazing health benefits they have experienced. So I decided, my “New Years Resolution” would be to do Keto, and have my first “cheat day” be on Super Bowl Sunday. I was going to give it a solid 5 weeks to prove to myself I can do this. I have the mental and physical strength to be able to do this diet. I hit the Keto subreddit, I did my research and on January 2nd, I officially began my first ever Keto experience. I remember that first week being extremely difficult. I bought a ton of Keto snacks to help me snack during the evening. I did very little exercise, but it worked. I remember so vividly my friends and family commenting around the 3rd week that my face looked thinner. Someone even commented at the golf club that they thought I lost 20 pounds, what was I doing? I even wore a white golf polo shirt for the first time in 3 years. Super Bowl Sunday came around, and as I watched Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs win their 1st Super Bowl against the 49ers, I gorged myself at a Super Bowl party with pizza, mac n cheese and any food that I dearly missed. I did not realize this at the time, but **this was my 1st ever relapse**. In the moment, this was my reward. I finally had a diet that worked for me. I finally had a weapon I could use moving forward and I was excited to get back on my Keto diet. However, that next Monday came, and I was back to eating carbs. “Just 1 more day” “I will start again tomorrow” I told myself. And my Keto diet never returned. 

**March 2020** – Although I did not start Keto during this period, this time in my life is extremely important to my reflection. I was only a few weeks removed from my first Keto experience and President Trump was on my TV at the podium, explaining how we all must stay locked down in our homes for 2 weeks. This was a time when the virus was 1st hitting the world, major changes were coming. How deadly is this virus? How many people that I love may die? Remember, this was at a time when we had no idea what this virus was. And what was my vice? **Carbs**. For the months of March and April during so much uncertainty, I turned to my favorite comfort foods and used them to address my emotional stress. I was staying home all day and just eating. I realized that my vice was food. I was able to function totally normal around all this uncertainty, and the only habit that changed about me was my eating habits and finding comfort in my favorite carb loaded meals. 

**January 2021** – A New Year rolls around, and once again I give my 2nd attempt of Keto. “I can get back to that. I did it last year, I can do it again” Sadly, this was a pathetic attempt and within 2 weeks, I was invited over to a friend’s house for a game night and I was eating pizza they had ordered. I went over without having dinner, and I was unprepared for the harmless “just 1 slice” mentality. I ended up having 4 slices and I just gave up on the Keto diet again. To be honest, my heart was never into this 2nd attempt, and I gave it a lousy effort. I came across 1 temptation and I failed. **This was my 2nd relapse**. However, I was hitting the gym on a consistent basis. I sold the idea to myself that if I was working out, then my keto diet should not matter, I was still taking steps to better my health. I got stronger, did not lose any weight. 

**April 2021** – My wedding was scheduled for the end of May 2021, 2 months from April 1st. I told myself “Let’s do the Keto diet for 7 weeks, lose 10-15 pounds for the wedding” and I found it extremely difficult to even start. I think for the first 2 weeks of April, I didn’t even start. I was too addicted to my favorite carb foods and said, “tomorrow I will start”. But eventually, I did go full Keto and did lose those 15 pounds for the wedding. I did mix in exercise in there as well and was the strongest I’ve been. Our wedding was a destination, so all our guests arrived around 5 days before the actual ceremony day. My friends, family and I drank and ate and celebrated like we should on a wedding. Thankfully the 5-day gorge pre-wedding did not have enough damage to wipe away my previous 5 weeks progress. My new wife and I went on our honeymoon, and I never returned to the Keto diet. **This was my 3rd relapse**. I again realized; Keto was an absolute weapon when I committed to it, and even more powerful with a workout plan. However, once I got home from the honeymoon, I once again struggled to get started. 

**January 2022** – Fast forward to now, a 3rd year, my 4th attempt at the Keto diet. I am currently 19 days through, and I am determined as ever. My workouts are strong, my hunger suppression has arrived, and I feel so energized when I wake up in the morning. And just last night, my wife and I are watching a mini-series called “Dopesick” on Hulu – an 8 episode show about the development and legalization of pharmaceutical opioids in America and the dangerous, addictive traits of the drug (highly recommend a watch). And as I am watching this show, I am realizing – **Carbs are my drug of choice**. I like to drink alcohol, smoke cigars, smoke weed, and gamble throughout my time as a young man, and none of these common societal addictions have ever stuck with me – they were just always a fun time. None of these “common vices” have ever got ahold of me the way my favorite carb loaded food has. And I also realize, my relapses were so harmless. I was so innocent in just giving into the temptation slightly and never returned to my goals. 

In all this reflection, I am coming to the realization that I cannot give into the slightest cheat. It’s an addiction I will probably have to fight the rest of my life just like any other addict does. However, I know this Keto diet can bring me all the tools I need to be successful. My goal “end date” for this 4th attempt – is none. I will continue this lifestyle change until it eventually becomes 2nd nature. And I look forward to reading about more success stories from others on this subreddit.",True,1,1.0,1,MaxRockafeller,False,False,keto

1642711136,I just want to feel normal again…,"TL;DR electrolytes got messed up and now I can’t seem to feel normal again, despite supplementing and increasing carbs in a desperate attempt to feel better. Bloods normal, waiting for doctors appointment.

Will start by saying I have previously been on Keto and rarely eat more than 120g carbs per day when not eating Keto (I know this is the upper limit of low carb, but nowhere near as high as a “typical modern diet”). I have also ready the FAQ and used the search feature.

I went back on Keto about 2 weeks ago and clearly skipped on the electrolytes because my symptoms got so bad (racing heart, dizziness, confusion, muscle cramps/spasms, nausea) that I ended up going to the emergency department thinking I was dying. I sipped some ketoade in the waiting room and started to feel better. By the time my bloods were drawn, my electrolytes were in the normal range, as was my blood pressure. The ECG showed my heart rate to be elevated at 105bpm, tachycardic for my age/sex (25/F/163lbs/5”7). No issues with kidney function etc.

This was five days ago and since then I have increased my carb intake to around 80-100g and focused on potassium rich foods, as well as liberally using the salt as I normally would. I have been getting around 4000-5000mg sodium and 3500mg potassium. I have been supplementing 450mg magnesium citrate for months anyway before Keto. I drink around 3 litres of liquid per day. Should I not be retaining electrolytes on this amount of carbs?

My problem is that I am still experiencing mild symptoms of electrolyte deficiency and it’s making me miserable. I am unbelievably nauseous during and after eating. My urine is very clear but my mouth still feels somewhat dry. I am booked in to see a doctor next week. 

Has anybody else had this sort of experience? Would it help to really “carb up” with pasta, oats etc to try and retain? The thought of any food at all is making me very nauseous. As I mentioned before I generally eat quite low carb usually and have done Keto in the past with very few issues.

1642727967,Inexplicable keto weight loss plateau - please help!,"* 36 year old female
* Starting weight: 85 kg / 187 lbs on September 1st 2021
* Current weight: 70 kg / 154 lbs on January 21st 2022
* Goal weight: 57 kg / 125 lbs
* Macros: 70g protein / 100g fat / 20g carbs / 5300 kj (1266 calories)

Hi everyone :) I started keto in September last year. Up until the start of January, I was losing weight consistently, but it started to slow down over the past month and has now reached a total stand still.

I exercise most days (90 minutes of walking at a fast pace, no weight lifting) and I’m extremely pedantic about calorie counting, checking ingredients etc - I use a keto app to track carbs and always double check nutritional information etc, so I’m certain that the issue isn’t that I’m accidentally overeating. 

When my weight loss started slowing down two weeks ago, I decided to try intermittent fasting (IF) in combo with keto to try break out of it, and have been eating 16:8 (8am to 4pm). I’ve been loving it - a bit peckish in the evenings but finding it easier than ever to stick to my macros and calorie limit. My first few months on keto I’d occasionally go slightly over my calorie limit but would still lose weight each week, so I thought I’d definitely lose a lot more now that I’m consistently under every day thanks to IF. But here’s the lame part - since starting IF two weeks ago, my weight loss is now at a total standstill - I’ve literally lost only 0.3 kg (about 0.5 lbs) in the past 2 weeks. I have a scale that measures my fat composition, muscle, water etc, and it’s not indicating that water retention or muscle mass gain is the culprit. I don’t have a blood ketone meter so I can’t check that, but I don’t see how I could \*not\* be in ketosis (I always stick below 20g carbs) - and even if somehow I wasn’t in ketosis, surely the fact that I’m under my daily calorie goal should lead to weight loss?

I thought it might be my hormones, but I recently got bloodwork done which confirmed that there's nothing wrong with my estrogen etc. I drink a lot of water, eat adequate fibre and I'm doing strict keto (as opposed to dirty or lazy keto).

I’m feeling really frustrated and demotivated, and unsure if I should stick to IF or not - I’m worried that maybe my body doesn’t like IF and my metabolism has slowed down or something like that. 

What do you reckon is going on with me? If I stick with IF &amp; keto at the current macros, will I eventually starting losing again, or do I need to increase my calories or something like that? Please advise me if you have any ideas - I’m feeling so lost!

Thanks in advance :)

but i can never stay carnivore long term because i dont like eating meat or animal products without plant products. yes while eating meat i feel like i'm eating real food, not fake food or cardboard*... but its not tasty. and yes i feel like meat is nutrition, not addiction.. my body tells me that.. but i just dont enjoy it enough to keep it going, so at some point i quit being carnivore. i dont remember enjoying one meal on carnivore over 8 months total (i keep switching between carnivore and non-carnivore in last 2 years or so). 

so what happens if i do this? 6 days a week i'm carnivore. on sundays, i eat anything i want. snacks, fast food, anything. i could even eat 1000g of carbs. this plan feel like something i can do long term like for the rest of my life.

i predict my arthritis problem probably wouldn't be solved because i think carbs and plants somehow increase friction and obstruction between my body tissues around the problematic areas. but i'd like to give it a shot. maybe it will work.

I just canceled my HelloFresh but have to keep doing it for a week so i dont waste so much food, after that i wanna go on a \~1000 calorie keto diet.

Part of me New Years resolution is to shed the 20 pounds I put on. So far it’s been great and working.

I would appreciate your advice, i have started my keto journey, I am slowly on the process of eliminating refined carbs from my diet. It has been difficult, but I have noticed some strange symptoms from the first day I gave up.

1642794032,Came to speak some truth.,"I see many pple with no idea about how weight loss actually works in this sub.

Here are some examples:

[1) ""They always said you can't lose weight after 30...""](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/s9hk2t/they_always_said_you_cant_lose_weight_after_30/)

[2) Can a extremely-low calorie keto diet work?](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/s99fh2/can_a_extremelylow_calorie_keto_diet_work/)

[3) 4 weeks on keto no weight loss.](https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/s8dscb/4_weeks_on_keto_no_weight_loss/)

Keto helps in stuff like sugar levels, not retaining too much water, brain functional level, etc.

But keto itself WON'T, repeat won'**T** make you lose weight.

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that will make you lose weight, specifically fat mass is a *caloric deficit.*

Example:

Your maintenance is 1500 cals a day.

Option A) You eat 1800 cals in keto. Even 1800 cals in just vegetables. You WILL gain weight. You WILL gain fat.

Option B) You eat 1300 cals in cookies and donuts. You WILL lose weight. You WILL lose fat.

Obviously, option B is not a healthy option tho, and the sugar levels in your blood will skyrocket. 

I do not mind giving further explanation, weightloss is that easy.

&amp;#x200B;

If your goal is losing weight stop keto, cuz if u don't fall in love with it and it causes anxiety about food you will end up leaving it and becoming paranoid about what u eat.

If you have other goals resulting from keto go ahead, but it has to be with other things than weight loss.

1642849353,Electrolytes doing more harm than good?,"So I've done keto in the past without really knowing what i was doing (before finding this sub). I did about 2 weeks of under 20g net carbs but I was so hyper I couldn't sleep on a night. After 2 week gave up. I thought the lack of sleep wouldn't be good for me plus it was really frustrating! 

In the meantime I've been practicing a low carb and intermittent fasting approach but the bad habits have slowly built up so decided to get back on it.

This time I did a bit more research (including on this sub) and found out about electrolytes. I've found it difficult to integrate that much sodium into my diet without making ketoade but with 0 carb sweetener (can't drink salt water).

The problem is after 2 weeks I've only had short bursts of keto energy although I've been sleeping fine. Is the sweetener kicking me out of ketosis? If so do I drop the ketoade and just focus on the carbs?

It takes a lot of planning to stay on keto with 3 kids, a partner and a full time job but what's the point if I'm not getting the benefits.

I was at a weight where I was comfortable, felt good, and clothes fit nicely.  Around November of 2021, I got kind of sick and had an aversion to most proteins/meat.

Quick question. 

So me and my girl have been doing keto for over a year now. When on keto, I noticed her having a very penetrating breath, after (what I think) eating garlic powder or onion powder. It's  not the keto breath as what happens when you're in the beginning of keto, the acetone smell. This is a very garlicky small,, but also not quite, very penetrating, and smellable from relatively far away.

We tried narrowing it down, thinking it might first be because of pork, but now we think it might actually either be garlic (powder) or onion (powder). Maybe even pepper.

In the past three years job change, grad school, and pandemic and I stopped doing keto. In that time, I gained all that weight back. My clothes slowly no longer fit and my wardrobe got bigger as I did. Nothing seemed to work. I was eating “healthy” according to my dietician. 1800 calories, high fiber, lots of veggies, lots of protein. Somewhere along the way I got convinced of my nutritionists and therapists words that keto is unhealthy. Years of being in therapy re eating disorders and I convinced myself that my intermittent fasting was the same as my calorie restrictions and disordered eating of eating nothing for days. A few weeks ago I realized I never felt better than when I was on keto. Not just did I lose weight but everything improved. My migraines and seizures were better. My chronic pain was not as bad. My acne went away. I had energy and focus. More importantly I was eating to feel good and not to feel guilty.

I do take medication to help me sleep. One of the side effects is that I want to eat if I do wake up in the middle of the night. It’s the craziest thing. Since Keto, I have been doing great. I would eat a piece of cheese or pork rinds. Last night was an exception. My mother-in-law made some fudge over the holidays and my wife put it in the freezer. I woke up at 4:00 am, had some cheese and ate some fudge. I feel guilty today. I did so well for over a month, zero sweets. I will be throwing the fudge in the trash, if I don’t have sweets, I can’t eat them. The purpose of this post is to tell on myself and to be accountable.

1642951239,I didn't remember that I needed that much salt,"Hi,

I did keto in 2017 and it gave me good results. I stopped doing it for many years. 5 years later, I'm back at my starting weight and decided to try to get on keto again. It is my second week and I already see lot of results, that's really nice.

Thing is, I think I didn't need to track my sodium and potassium intakes that much five years ago. Plus, I didn't feel any adverse effects of being on keto (I don't remember having any side effects related to the keto flu). 

Right now, I feel like I need to add a lot of salt and potassium chloride to any water glass I take throughout the day, because I sometimes feel light headed, with fatigue and accelerated heart rate.

Well, since I add so much sodium and potassium (and sometime magnesium) to my diet, I am worried about consuming too much? It is part of the keto flu?  Will the adverse effects will go away with time?

Light exercise helps a lot too
I typically do a 18 hour fast with a 6 hour eating window. Water and black coffee only when I’m fasting. I’ll break the fast with a grass fed burger patty and cheese. I’ll drink green tea, bubly, eat pistachios, boiled eggs, cheese whisps and pork rhines for snacks before my final meal. For dinner it’s typically wild salmon cooked in olive oil and butter, which is a top tier protein, with a veggie like broccoli and avocado. If I do get a sweet tooth I do fage 5% greek yogurt with a bit of monk fruit chocolate chips, only a couple of times a week. I take my electrolytes and wheat grass juice and apple cider vinegar at night. I feel great and shed fat rather consistently. Ideally you want to do any exercise while you’re fasted.

1643033924,Have we been sabotaging ourselves for 50 years?,"Back in the mid-1960s, nutritionists and doctors began to teach us to lower fat intake due to its tie to cardiovascular disease. I remember it finally beginning to reach community awareness in the late 1970s as these things take time. A quick google shows that obesity rates began to increase in the 1980s as many manufacturers began to market fat-free foods that just substituted sugar instead. On top of that, even as a scratch cook, that awareness made me reduce my fat intake. So what did I do? Sure I ate my veggies, but it meant more bread, pasta, and potatoes.

As a result, I have lived a life struggling with overeating because I always felt hungry. Sure I occasionally stress ate, but my main drive to consume was a gnawing hunger in my stomach. I even went to the MD for this. Chronic gastritis, but no other disorder found. Was put on anticholinergics to slow my stomach activity. I could not go to bed without a snack or my stomach would keep me awake. 

Now on keto, my stomach has finally calmed down. Wow. I can't help but wonder how many of us would never have struggled with our weight if we had continued to keep the fat in our diets?

1643037220,A year of keto (sort of),"I just realized that it's almost my keto anniversary. I was wearing leggings today and passed by a huge mirror. I've already hit my goal and have been in maintainance for a while. But I didn't realize how much thinner I look now until I saw my reflection. 

I actually am not strictly on keto anymore. More of low carb, just because it's hard for me to stay full keto with my current setup. I am still able to maintain despite the change. I credit that to how doing keto changed my relationship with food. But I really do intend to go back to keto when I am able to (which is hopefully soon). I just feel healthier and better overall when I was on keto. 

I don't really have a decent before and after pic. I didn't really like taking photos of myself back then. And honestly, I've had so many failed weight loss attempts so I didn't really bother. But here's a photo of me a few months into keto (around 25lbs lost by that time) vs today.

*In the 30 years after Eisenhower’s heart attack, trial after trial failed to conclusively bear out the association he claimed to have identified \[between saturated fats and heart attacks\]\[...\]*

*The nutritional establishment wasn’t greatly discomfited by the absence of definitive proof, but by 1993 it found that it couldn’t evade another criticism: while a low-fat diet had been recommended to women, it had never been tested on them (a fact that is astonishing only if you are not a nutrition scientist). The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute decided to go all in, commissioning the largest controlled trial of diets ever undertaken. As well as addressing the other half of the population, the Women’s Health Initiative was expected to obliterate any lingering doubts about the ill-effects of fat.*

*It did nothing of the sort. At the end of the trial, it was found that women on the low-fat diet were no less likely than the control group to contract cancer or heart disease. This caused much consternation. The study’s principal researcher, unwilling to accept the implications of his own findings, remarked: “We are scratching our heads over some of these results.” A consensus quickly formed that the study – meticulously planned, lavishly funded, overseen by impressively credentialed researchers – must have been so flawed as to be meaningless.

1643077234,Even Less Lazy(ish) Keto 112 days later == 68 lbs lost,"Hello again Internet.

Its been 16 weeks since I started restricting carbohydrates to less than 20 grams a day and I am a completely different man, mentally and physically.

In my last post I had some goals.

&gt; Weigh 10 pounds (4.5 kg) less - 343 pounds

Done and then some.  This morning I woke up and weighed in at 334.6 lbs (151 kg)

&gt;Continue daily aerobic exercise with the same calorie expenditure as my 5k - read close my calorie ring and exercise ring. (1000 kcal and 50 minutes)

24 out of 28 days have my apple watch rings closed.  I had some shiftwork and travel with crazy hours on the days I did not close the rings.  So I think this is okay.

&gt; Attain an 11'00"" / km pace while walking 5km (current is 11'30"" on a good day)

Did this about 3 times in the last 28 days.  Will continue to work on making this more the norm.

&gt;Continue my strength training program. Gonna just set 3 days a week and leave it here. I will see. COVID is pretty bad now and I am not not keen on going to a gym. Luckily I have dumbbells and I can buy a bench.

Done.  In fact I moved to a 4 day upper/lower split recently.  I really enjoy manipulating the potential energy of dense objects, maybe not in the moment but I feel great after and am actually finding myself wanting to go, which was not the guy I was 4 months ago.

So over the last 4 months a lot has changed in my approach.  At first I was completely lazy keto no exercise, etc.  Now I am actively pursuing daily aerobic exercise and weight lifting.  While actively measuring and recording everything that I consume.  I have decided that this is the way.  My current nutrition plan is:  &lt;20 grams of carbs, 175 - 200 grams of protein, less than 2000 Calories.  I do not track fat directly because I do not need it for energy.  I still have plenty to spare.  I have never really hit 2000 Calories in a day, I hover around 1700 - 1900 Calories.

Also, I had a dexa scan and resting metabolic rate test done.  My dexa was better than expected.  About 45% body fat with 176 lbs of lean mass.  Previous to this I was going for about 150 grams of protein.  I upped my protein accordingly and also to help repair muscle after weight lifting.  My resting metabolic rate was 2650 Calories a day with a project maintenance intake of about 3700 Calories (generic uppers for calories like housework and things).  That is amazingly ridiculous.  I must have been consuming an enormous amount of  Calories to gain and maintain my weight.  The numbers more or less checkout.  Given my caloric deficit, math predicts a 15 pound loss in 28 days.  Which is pretty close to my 19 pound loss.  The dexa and the RMR measurement are pretty useful.

Something I have noticed is that a lot of people get caught up with being in or out of ketosis.  I have decided that a motto for a carb restriction diet should be: ""Ketosis is not a goal, its a byproduct.""  Just like people say you don't lose weight to get healthy, you get healthy then lose weight.  Weight loss, while being a goal, is naturally a byproduct of getting the metabolic/hormonal systems put back in check in the body.

Everything else remains awesome.  I am currently waiting on blood test results to have some further data on my progress.  I am particularly interested in my fasting insulin level to get another measure of my insulin resistance.  Hopefully this week I will get those results then I plan on posting a before/after type analysis.

So lets set some goals:

1. Lose an additional 10 pounds (324 lbs).  It looks like I am low balling this, and I am - the grind has to start at some point.
2. Continue my strength training and cardio routines. 4 days a week for strength and cardio 6 days a week.
3. I really only have two goals for this next 28 day cycle, lol.  Just keep hustling. 

I had some pretty good NSVs with fitting in airplane seats, but I am too le tired to keep typing. 

Like I say, if you made it this far, thank you.  If you made it this far and are looking to change your life by dropping carbs - just do it. 

Remember that ketosis is not a goal, it's a byproduct.

My questions are:
1. If my sodium is low but potassium seems to be fine as per the FAQ, should I just be putting salt (not lite salt) in my Ketoade? 

2. Does the kind of salt really matter? Ive got a bunch of salt here at home and I’d love to avoid going to the grocery store and buying expensive pink salt or something 

3. How am I supposed to know what I’m at for magnesium or if I need supplements? I do eat spinach lots and drink coffee but it seems any app (crono or MFP) that tracks magnesium as a macro hides it as a premium feature and I don’t want to pay just for that.

One of my main issues is that I’m almost always hungry and typically end up eating every 2-3 hours (it’s hard for me to go longer than that), which makes it difficult to lose weight and not go over my calories. I’ve always been this way, but just learned it can be caused by Insulin Resistance. 

Has anyone else experienced this and been able to reverse it over time with Keto? And does anyone have any advice for me to deal with being hungry all the time/lowering insulin related hunger?

1643126029,I could some encouragement/support especially if you can relate,"I started Keto October 10, 2021 and since then I have stayed under 20 net carbs every day since, except for last night.

 (I want to preface this story with saying that I do not like negative word associations for food. Words that have moral and ethical meanings such as ""bad, good, wrong, right and cheat"" are all words that I avoid. I had 2 eating disorders in my past and it has taken years of unlearning all the toxic diet language and negative associations that fueled my thinking patterns and gave me such a toxic relationship with food. I will say that I have been at a mentally healthy place for several years and when I started Keto, my relationship with food became the best it ever has been. And that is part of the reason why I think what just happened is messing with me. It has surprised me and humbled me, but not in a good way.)

So last night, after over 3 months of not going over 20 carbs, I decided it was alright to have my sister's chocolate cake and I let myself do it with intention and I said mentally ""no guilt! enjoy!"" That was all fine. But then I came home and after putting the kids to bed, I ate a bunch of the fresh bread the host sent home with me. I couldn't believe it. It's like if I started on the slide, I just shot the whole way down. I was alright with the first non-keto eating. But not the second. First one I felt in control. The second felt like a total loss of control. 

Wake up this morning and I felt some internal guilt and shame but I told myself it was alright and to get back on track. I step on the scale and I am up 3 pounds. That felt bad. I know these aren't always accurate but I have always shown that I am in ketosis and today I was not in the pink and that was discouraging. Still, I told myself to have self-compassion, let it go, and just focus on getting back on track and so I keto'd on with my normal keto day. Then after my keto lunch, I was still hungry and I just impulsively grabbed the nonketo bread on the table and went at it. What the heck?! I have had non-keto food in my house the whole time since October. I make non-keto foods for my kids everyday. I never take a bite! I don't even taste the recipe! I have made them cookies. I've made it through Thanksgiving and Christmas with staying under my macros. And today, somehow after last night, it's like I snapped.

What worries me the most is the lack of self-control. That is what used to be my problem. Gaining self-control around food is one of my favorite gains with Keto!! For as long as I can remember food has been like this huge metaphorical giant in my thoughts, consuming my mind, my scheduling and planning, what I would look forward to, days and events planned around food, how I would emotionally eat, when happy, when sad, when stressed. With Keto, it has simply been ""food."" Like the giant shrunk down to a little pebble. Just this thing that occupies a tiny speck in my mind and when I start to feel hunger, real hunger, then I eat to satiate. That is all. With what happened last night and today, it is like an old habit which I thought I conquered came back and made me disbelieve my strength, made me doubt myself, and lose confidence. I was confident I could do keto for life. At least low carb for life. I don't want to lose all the benefits I've gained. 

I think if I really look deep down, a part of this whole incident could also be coming from resentment at the fact that I have only lost 15 pounds. From 10/10/2021 to now, I've gone from 199lbs to 185lbs. I see people writing on here that they have lost 30, 40, 50lbs in that time frame and so my weight loss seems excruciatingly slow. Especially for how strict I've been and that I exercise 4 times a week. A part of me was like ""screw it! I'm barely even losing weight any way!"" And as I reflect, I also do not like that thinking because losing weight is not the only benefit. I want to remember the other benefits as the reason I do keto. But f it, seriously the weight loss is a big one and it feels like it's going sooooo slowly. I have been at 185 since December 31st. 

I'm not trying to be melodramatic, I process my thoughts and feelings through writing and I usually journal but today with journaling, I can't find solid enough encouragement for myself and so that is why I am turning here to this community for encouragement and support. I can tell I'm slipping into ""beating myself up"" mentality and losing some of my former mental strength and I want to do something, I am doing something by writing here to try and change the tide.

Now my main question, If your on a true keto diet of &lt;20g carb and always in an Ketosis state, does that effect the stages? would you not hit 18hr stage in a shorter time since you are producing Ketones before then? or am I missing understanding it and it is Ketones produce by your fat on the body and no from food.

1643140464,Figuring out electrolytes,"This is my third time doing keto. First two times, there were a couple days of feeling meh but bounced back quickly, felt great, and didn’t need to supplement any electrolytes. I was tracking my macros very closely those times so I’m sure I was in ketosis. This time the keto flu has hit hard putting me in a mental fog, have elevated HR, muscle weakness, and trouble sleeping 

So some questions:
1. How have other people figured out the amount of electrolytes they need? Trial and error? Is there some way to measure? I’ve seen the recommendations in the FAQ but still have some keto flu side affects while taking those amounts. Also don’t want to overdo it and go from hypo to hyper
2. Any idea why my experience is so different this time?
3. Can protein intake affect electrolytes? Been trying to do a more plant based keto this time so protein intake is probably low

Some other factors:
Doing keto for neurological and metabolic benefits but not weight loss (not sure if cal deficit requires greater electrolytes?)
Taking amitryptyline due to concussions for sleep/headaches and I’ve seen that this can deplete electrolyte levels (so possibly the answer to #2) 
Electrolyte intake right now is around 4000 mg sodium, 2000 mg potassium, 500 mg magnesium (been playing around with sodium and potassium levels)

1643141139,"One year+ on keto - bloodwork, pcos, overall quality of life improved.","At almost 40 I had bloodwork bad enough my doctor was mentioning meds, it took years of fertility treatment and loss before I had my twins, I'd never had a regular period ever (PCOS), I was always hungry but ate like a dieting bird. I was roughly 185-190 lbs and I am only 5'3"". Triglycerides were 230mg/dL just for an official number of one reading.

In researching PCOS one thing kept popping up: sugar is bad. Well, almost. There were tons of documents and studies and advice saying to eat whole grains (I did) and avoid enriched (I did). But I finally truly read about keto and thought - if my body does such a bad job processing sugar, why not try not giving it ANY?

So I went keto. And I *melted*. That's really the best way to describe it. I almost immediately felt better, and I dropped weight so fast people told me they were ""concerned"". My doctor, though, was actually thrilled after my first appointment and showing I'd dropped 20 lbs or so. (I made sure to tell the annoying commentators that I literally had doctor approval.)

Fast forward to now. My triglycerides last check were 81ml/dL (to save research I guess they should be less than 149ml/dL according to report chart that came with my bloodwork.) I now weigh around 130-135 lbs. My period is regular for the first time ever, and I even had a chuckle with my doctor about how at almost 40 I might actually have to worry about birth control methods. (I was so infertile it was impossible to get pregnant without heavy meds. Now, though...maybe not.) 

My experience with pcos and keto:
+ Way more energy
+ Never hungry unless I forget multiple meals
+ Bloodwork is perfect now, no meds needed
+ Regular period I can actually track

- hirsutism NOT gone (kinda hoped it would, lol)
- I get cold easier

I was a major sugar addict who would still avoid it regardless before keto. Now? I walk by a bakery and it smells AMAZING... but I don't want to eat it. I told a coworker I compare it to smelling a candle now. Smells great but I have no urge to eat the candle, either.

2. Use total carbs, we could absorb fiber so dont neglect dietary fiber but sugar alcohol are OK.

As I got older my eating habits got worse and worse. In 2011 I was my smallest after living away from home with predone meals. 2012 due to being back home, and medication I was at my worst of 340 pounds. I would drink 2 liters of soda right form the bottle, bags of chips and more. When I started working it got worse on my days off I would by snacks if I had 2 days off in a row I would get 4 two liters to drink. Many of my doctors were warning me to stop, but I never listened.

In August I went to a walk in to get one of the issues looked at, in which they checked my bloodsugar, that day it was 562.

I thought it may have been because of my calories (I’m trying to get under 2000 a day but am consistently hitting 2000-2500) but my father (who is a fitness coach and has personal and professional experience of keto) said that my grams of fat intake is more important. At the moment, I use Cronometer because it shows a nice visual representation of my daily macros but this is measured in calories not grams. I’ve got my carb budget set at 20g but not got anything set for fat (although I average about 150-200g a day). His suggestion was to try to get up to 200g of fat a day (which would push my calories up towards 3000) and ignore the calories. 
I’m a bit conflicted because I’ve heard from some people that calories don’t matter as much on keto (so long as you’re not going up to 5000 or something ridiculous) and it’s part of the reason why I started. But I’ve also heard from others that you should still try to eat a ‘Normal’ amount of calories (or even a deficit) on keto so I’m really not sure what to focus on.

Looking for similar experiences or any insight!! Thanks :)

I’ve double checked this several times now. My doctor suggested I monitor fasting and postprandial glucose since I qualifiy for prediabetes and high insulin. 

I’ve been keto a month now. When eating in a calorie deficit I have great fasted blood glucose at 84. Over the last week my appetite really spiked. I’m not in a big rush to lose weight as much as I am to lower insulin so I’ve eaten over my calorie limit multiple days (within keto: pork rinds, macadamia nuts, etc.) by probably 1000ish calories and each time, the day following my blood glucose has been 97-115. 

Also, I notice I feel some symptoms that I used to associate with overeating carbs: overheating/sweating, night sweats, a bit of brain fog, mood swing-y. (My doctor had said these are sometimes associated with hyperinsulinemia…this was when I was pre-keto.) Again, when I was eating in a calorie deficit, same foods—just less, I didn’t experience any of this. 

I’m keeping up on my electrolytes and I don’t eat “keto treats” except for Lily’s. 

Does anyone else experience this? Or maybe have some insight? 

I realize the solution is eat less since that was working for me but I’m confused—I thought my blood glucose for example wouldn’t rise with overeating fat.

Anybody using/used Keto specifically for visceral fat loss? Or have any insight as to weight loss results via keto related to sleep?

I have been on the fence for the past month about making a comprehensive guide to starting and maintaining Keto. I have been living the Keto lifestyle for roughly 10 years and the majority of guides and videos available are done by people that have only researched Keto, only provide cooking recipes, only do workout videos, or just look intimidating and unbelievable. 

I am looking at making this guide to walk the average overweight person from start to finish making exercise an option. 

The reason I say make exercise an option because the main reason people are looking to start Keto are looking to lose weight. 

Coming from someone who has been on the medications, been heavy, been self conscious; talking about making a diet change AND starting to workout might seem a bit overwhelming especially when the notorious Keto flu comes creeping around. 

So, if you guys are interested in a Comprehensive Guide to Keto let me know.

- How to read a nutrition label properly 
- what artificial Sweetners to avoid
-  how to start Keto
- how to use the GI index

&amp;#x200B;

After holidays at home, eating non-stop, and gaining some extra pounds, I’ve decided that I need a complete detox program and start working at least 2-3 per week. Well, that’s my belated New Year’s resolution, and I’ll try my best to stick to it during the whole year. But, at least I try.

&amp;#x200B;

So, I’ve started this thread because I’ve read about how healthy eating greens daily can be. Besides, after trying one smoothie in one place, I actually fall in love with it. The taste is awful, I have to admit it. But the effect is incredible. I actually felt energized and didn’t even want to grab a cup of coffee during my lunch break. Besides, after drinking this smoothie daily, my skin became better. I finally got rid of the acne and got this fresh and radiant look. But the cost of one medium-size smoothie is more than $15. I know that this price might seem reasonable, primarily when you invest in your health. But, after going to that place daily, I’ve realized that I’m spending too much money on it, and I can do the same at home. Besides, I sneaked picked the recipe while making one portion for me.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I’m thinking of buying this blender with a portable bottle — GoPower Elite Blender. My old stationary blender has seen better times, and I need to replace it.

&amp;#x200B;

So, coming back to the recipe. Those are the ingredients they put in my green smoothie:

&amp;#x200B;

One medium Avocado

One cucumber

Green apple

A bit of ginger.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry that I didn’t put proportions correctly or at all since I was just watching what they put in there. But that is what I saw they put in there. I would highly appreciate it if you could help me improve it a little bit. But, overall, I’m satisfied with the effect. In my opinion, it’s not just a drink, but a complete meal.

I've been trying to change my lifestyle for almost 2 years now and can't seem to stay dedicated to it. I have zero willpower and motivation when it comes to not eating carbs/sugar even though I know I'll feel (and look) healthier if I do 😅

Backstory:

 I was diagnosed with pcos in 2016. My main symptoms have been poor weight control, insulin resistance, hirsutism, and cystic acne. After the initial blood test (testosterone, fasting glucose, and insulin) and ultrasound in 2016, my obgyn gave me metformin and birth control and never mentioned anything about it after that. I stayed with this ob for 4 more years, and not once did she recheck my hormones and glucose despite me being on metformin and not feeling any better than before treatment.

In 2020, I finally found a gyn who knows a ton about pcos and is determined to help me get it under control. He rechecked everything I had been tested for in 2016, along with a1c and vitamins. It turns out my a1c is very elevated (6.2), and I am deficient in vitamins D3 and B12. I've been taking otc D3 and B12 supplements and have seen much improvement in those levels according to my most recent test 3 days ago. My a1c and fasting glucose, however, are still high (a1c = 6, glucose =105). Since September 2020, I have been trying to fix this issue by losing weight and adapting to a keto lifestyle. I started a food log and tracked macros (carbs, fat, protein), trying to stay below 60g net carbs per day. Between Sept 2020 and Nov 2020, I went from weighing ~280lbs to ~250. Everything was going good for those first 2 months, but I stopped after getting a bad stomach bug because carbs/sugar were the only things that didn't make me nauseous. I haven't been able to stay on keto at all since then. I have lost a lot of weight in the last 6 months because I have a very active job, and I started taking adipex (phentermine). Even after going from ~265 lbs to ~220 lbs between June 2021 and now, my a1c has only dropped 0.2 points because I can't stay away from sugar. How can I do low carb if I am literally addicted to &amp; surrounded by sugar 24/7???

(Fun fact - I initially went to my current doctor for endometriosis concerns, which I also now know I have because he immediately got me scheduled for a diagnostic lap &amp; excision surgery after my first appointment! I didn't realize he also knew so much about pcos. My previous obgyn refused to acknowledge my endo symptoms despite family history because, according to her, my pain wasn't ""bad enough to be endo."" She also claimed that my symptoms weren't pcos because ""the only definite sign of pcos are ovarian cysts,"" which I don't normally have. I knew that wasn't true, and you don't have to have polycystic ovaries to have pcos. I eventually had to bring my mom to an appointment to convince her to test me for pcos because I was showing the same signs of it as her.)",True,1,1.0,0,FrozenDuality,False,False,keto

I wanted to share what happened at my annual physical. I brought up that my total cholesterol had gone down since the last lipid draw. He brushed it off and said he's not worried about my cholesterol at all. 

Then he showed me a tab in my (electronic) chart. It was my ""ASCVD 10-year risk score."" It takes many factors into account. Age, gender, tobacco status, blood pressure reading, race, HDLs and total cholesterol. And then it gave my estimate risk for having a first heart attack in the next 10 years based on those factors.

My risk is 0.7% out of 100%

He said if my cholesterol stays the same, he'd probably start taking about treating it when I'm 65 or so when that percentage risk goes above 10% (due to age). He said obviously mine is mostly genetic, and as long as I was ""eating healthfully"" and ""not eating KFC every day,"" that he didn't expect any of my risk to change.

What I found interesting was that weight/BMI wasn't part of the calculations. He replied no, it's not used for much anymore because it's just not shown to correlates with risk. And for the conditions where size is a risk factor, he said they're using waist: height ratios these days. 

It's nice to have a doctor who is (1) happy if I eat a low carb/keto diet (2) doesn't care about my LDLs begging above 250.

I hope people searching here about their cholesterol and being pushed statins will read this. Then, of they're freaking that pressure, they'll ask their doctor about their ASCVD risk.

I feel like I go to food for a dopamine hit instead of hunger (not good! I know) but since it’s not carby stuff I don’t get any reward feeling and so then I just sort of feel like a bottomless pit. I don’t have carb cravings in that I’m thinking about carby foods, I’m just thinking about the act of eating (lol hard to explain..?).  

Especially with things like pork rinds, crunchy cheese or nuts—I could easily eat my days calories (and beyond…!) just on these.

1643386445,Potassium question re: Mark Sisson's homemade electrolyte drink,"Hi,

I usually use Redmond Re-Lyte for my ketoade because it's easy, has good electrolyte proportions, and is better cost per serving than LMNT (although I like how salty LMNT tastes better).

That said, wanted to switch it up and saw Mark Sisson mentioned what he does. Per MDA: ""My favorite way to get a big dose of these electrolytes in one fell swoop is to pour a big glass of sparkling mineral water (I like [Gerolsteiner](https://www.gerolsteiner-usa.com/home.html)) and add juice from 2 limes or lemons, a teaspoon of salt, and a scoop of magnesium powder. Great and incredibly refreshing. Sip on that twice a day, and you’ll be fine.""

Really tastes great and salty so it's been a welcome change. However, today I mixed it and used cronometer to track ingredients because I wanted to see how much electrolytes. For potassium it only gave about 420mg (I assume this was the purpose of the juice), but a lot of carbs. Doesn't seem like it makes much of a difference; Re-lyte does have 500mg per scoop, but doesn't cost carbs.

Am I missing anything with the juice aspect here?

Now, reading the FAQ, it starts to make sense - looks like I simply enter ketosis overnight. The other symptoms check out - particularly the metallic breath and increased thirst. Often I wake up in the night to get some water - I'm used to this and always keep a bottle next to my bed.

I'm on a high-meat diet, but I definitely eat a lot more than those 20 grams of carbs a day. However, after eating, for example, a pizza, I clearly feel a lot weaker during workout.

I'm pretty much always hungry, but after eating high-carb food such as pizza or dumplings, I get what I call ""Great Hunger"", where I end up ordering like 2 pizzas and still getting hungry few hours later.

According to an online calorie calculator, with my current weight and with the aim of mild weight loss, 1,500 calories should be okay. But it is a 32% deficit. I know the FAQ says to aim for closer to 15-20% when starting out. I do not want to slow my metabolism any, but have been pretty satiated so far by just hitting the 1500 a day. Should I be aiming for closer to 20% deficit? 

Few other facts: 
Doing a high-protein method, so 19g Carbs, 132g Protein, 101g Fat daily. Comes out to 5/35/60 ratio. 

Also doing a 10/14 fasting window from 6:30am to 4:30 daily (more as a personal discipline thing, as my night snacking gets out of hand)

I have been carnivore for the past 2 years and in December incorporated more lower carb veggies/fruit into my meals (only avocado and cauliflower right now).

A few other details are that I drink black coffee, tea and water through the day as well. I also do a CrossFit workout every morning to start my day.

I have been carnivore for around 1.5 years. Keto 6 months before that. I went all in because one day I just decided vegetables seemed totally unappealing. I think this is pretty common when you get deep into just eating meat. 

Sometimes I have little bits here and there of a friend's Turkish takeaway, for example, and the meat in that will have filler in it. And I feel like my body can take a lot more without triggering the symptoms of insulin resistance (which is peripheral neuropathy - that made me try keto in the first place). 

And generally I've been thinking when I have a little bit of carbs, my body seems to react slightly more calmly to the protein it's getting. So I was wondering if anyone has ever gone back to eating veggies or carbs to control blood sugar?

One is that I can cross my legs comfortably and for longer periods now. My legs also hang parallel and touch each other when I cross them, versus having the top leg at an angle. 

Another is my kneecaps. They used to be just round. I can actually make out the knobs on my knees.

I eat less than 20 carbs a day (total, not net), track and weigh everything, get adequate magnesium/potassium/sodium each day. I drink 100 or more ounces of water each day. I don't eat keto ""snacks"" or fat bombs.

I'm 67F, 5'1, current weight 156 lbs. My macros are just over 1K calories per day, 16g carbs/80g fat/78g protein, and I rarely rarely exceed them. I've lost a little weight from my starting weight of 163, but that seems to have stopped. I occasionally (about 2x/week) drink 1 to 2 cocktails in an evening -- usually Canadian whiskey, sometimes vodka or gin -- on the rocks or with a sugar-free mixer. I'm typically IF 18/6, occasionally OMAD.

I generally get about 30 minutes of light exercise a day -- usually riding my bike, occasionally walking.

My A1C on Dec. 6 was 14.2, which shocked and horrified both my doctor and me. Doc wanted to go straight to insulin, but luckily she doesn't mind me arguing with her, and I persuaded her to let me try keto + Metformin for 3 months. She said she doesn't think keto and Metformin will adequately control my blood sugar, although she was encouraging about my willingness to try.

Doc has me on 1000mg Metformin 2x/daily, morning and evening. Started testing blood glucose 3-5x/day on Dec. 7. Blood glucose has come down from an average of 350+ to an average of 200, but is no longer dropping significantly. Typical range is 200-220 overnight fasting, 200-215 before and after meals. I will sometimes (but rarely) get a reading in the 170s or 180s at bedtime.

As of today, I have officially lost 100lbs (101 to be exact)! I started the diet June 1. Last year. I started off with intermittent fasting, which naturally turned into OMAD, which I have been doing since probably August. There have been times where cravings were high, with temptations all around, but I’m proud to say that I have only cheated on the diet once, and it was preplanned (holiday). 
I now only have 28 pounds to go, and I’m still motivated and having a great time. I don’t really see much of a change when I look in the mirror, which is strange, but I have gone down 3 sizes in shirts, sweaters etc. Which of course meant that I had to give away all my clothes and buy new ones 💸. But it has all been worth it, because although I don’t see the physical change myself, I feel so much better! I guess the eyes will follow suit after a while.
