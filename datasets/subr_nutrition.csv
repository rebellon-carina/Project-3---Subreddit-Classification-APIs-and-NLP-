Now, I've seen people say that eating cod liver (the actually liver, not the oil) is healthy. I got a **small** 60g can of it and at the back it says that even just **half** the can contains 280% of Vitamin A's Daily Value. Which means the whole can (and I do insist to specify it is quite small, so eating the whole can is super easy) has 560% of Vitamin A's DV. 

Isn't that dangerously high? I kinda feel deceived that cod liver is being recommended as something healthy but these same people don't warn you about Vitamin A toxicity...

Wouldn’t this essentially make many nuts and seeds inflammation machines? Eating just a handful or two of some of my favorites (sunflower seeds and almonds) would, theoretically, COMPLETELY throw off your ratio for the day even if you had a little bit of salmon with it.

Or does omega 6 consumption only affect your ratio in regards to ALA consumption, and can be neglected as long as you get adequate amounts of DHA/EPA?

It makes sense to me that the fats in vegetable oils are unhealthy due to oxidation caused by the heating process. However, if your ratio is affected by pure omega-6 intake, I don’t understand how nuts and seeds don’t destroy the ratios of even normal people who are consuming fish a few times a week.

I use Cronometer to track my nutrition, and there is a prescribed required amount of each essential amino acid, and then an overall required amount of protein for each day. I am just looking for sources with an explanation for the following scenario:

I was building a day plan from the ground up, and saw that after two meals I met all my essential amino acid requirements, but total protein amount was still only about half of the requirement. I am not well educated on this topic, but from what I have heard these should be going hand in hand? 

If I would be using a protein source with an unbalanced amino acid profile on top of this to meet my total protein requirement for the day, would that be as equally effective as using a protein source with a balanced amino acid profile?

1641562770,Why is Refined Sugar unhealthy? What are the best alternatives?,"  


In general, excessive food consumption will eventually end up bad for your health. It is the same case when it comes to sugar as well.  


Sugar is a sweetening soluble substance that is commonly taken as table sugar or refined cane sugar. Table sugar is bad for health when consumed more than the recommended daily intake which is a maximum of 50gms of sugar per day for an adult according to WHO. However, only in the US, the average sugar intake is around 77gms per day.  


This is because table sugar has a high Glycemic Index of about 65. Glycemic Index is the measure of positive variations in glucose in blood sugar levels. More the Glycemic Index, more glucose is mixed faster with your blood which is bad for your health. No wonder, why diabetic patients are advised to consume foods that have a low glycemic index.

1641648062,Why do we include protein intake as a % of TDEE?,"After watching Fat Fiction, this has got me wondering. Specifically the part where they mention protein is essential and, after that, fuel your body with either carbs and/or fats.

I’ve always calculated TDEE and then assign percentages to protein, fats, and carbs, which dictated my meals.

Example:
TDEE - 1000 cal
40% protein - 400 cal
30% carb - 300 cal
30% fat - 300 cal

I am confused as to why we include protein in the energy intake - isn’t it really difficult to use protein as an energy source? Isn’t it only used when all other glycogen stores have been depleted during exercise? I imagine the protein you eat is used for muscle repair etc (mostly) and doesn’t actually help you meet your TDEE. 

In other words, if you assign 40% protein of TDEE, you could be running a deficit of 40% in energy intake?

Would it make sense (if not, help me understand why) if you calculate your protein intake (gram per body weight) and then make up your TDEE with fats/carbs.

Example:
Body weight - 60 kg
Protein requirement - 1.2 g per kg
Daily protein goal - 72 g

TDEE - 1000 cal
(equal amounts carb/fat like previous example)

if one person is consuming high amounts of carbohydrates, as in a tradicional diet, they will store those as glycogen. but, if they are planning to lose weight, and are in a caloric deficit, which calorie will they burn more? the stored sugar calorie or the stored fat calories? and this will unnecessarily slow down fat loss?

in a context of a low carb diet, it is more easy to tap into the fat reserve, and constantly be burning it, because of the low content of stored sugar and the low insulin. so maybe that explains why low carb diets burns the most fat in general, according to several studies?

1641761719,Arsenic in Rice Update: I've made a GUIDE for you guys on sourcing rice and the problem arising from the inorganic toxin,"Someone else recently made a post about a cooking method to reduce the amount of arsenic in rice when cooking (I can't locate it now or I'd link it. OP might have deleted it). Anyway, there was a lot of interest in it and some people *didn't even know* there was arsenic in rice.

This is a topic I once spent a lot of time on, so I thought I'd share with you my findings given the interest. This post **will not go over cooking methods**. It's a whole separate topic. I'm going to cover the problem and **how to select the best rice for you.**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**THE PROBLEM (How it relates to your health):** ""Inorganic arsenic is ranked by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as one of more than 100 substances that are Group 1 carcinogens. It is known to cause bladder, lung, and skin cancer in humans, with the liver, kidney, and prostate now considered potential targets of arsenic-induced cancers."" \[[1](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/11/arsenic-in-your-food/index.htm)\]

**ARSENIC LEVELS IN FOOD ARE NOT WELL REGULATED BY THE FDA**

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**SOURCES (Where it's coming from):**  ""The main sources of arsenic pollution include certain pesticides and herbicides, wood preservatives, phosphate fertilizers, industrial waste, mining activities, coal burning, and smelting."" \[[2](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/arsenic-in-rice#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4)\]

Humans can be exposed in the diet from contaminated drinking water, some seafood, and the biggest food offender: rice and rice-based products. **Rice is particularly concerning for these reasons:** 1) Grown in irrigated water-saturated environments (paddies)... 2) Arsenic accumulates in the soil from decades of prior/existing use... 3) Compared to other foods, rice seems to naturally absorb a lot of arsenic \[[3](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/11/arsenic-in-your-food/index.htm)\]\[[4](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/arsenic-in-rice#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4)\]

List of common offending rice-based products:

* Rice milk 
* Rice bran
* Rice-based breakfast cereals
* Rice cereal (baby rice)
* Rice crackers
* Brown rice syrup
* Cereal bars containing rice and/or brown rice syrup.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**MY PERSONAL TAKEAWAY (Regarding risk):** Since learning this information a few years ago, *I have drastically reduced my rice intake*. When I do have rice, it's seldom and from one of the better ones (listed below). More often than not, I opt for non-rice grains like quinoa. That said, **the risk appears to be dose-dependent**. Meaning the more rice you eat, the more arsenic you will accumulate. The most susceptible in my opinion (which is shared by others) are infants and children who eat rice-based cereals and products marketed for their age group. 

People who are gluten-free are also at risk because most gluten-free products use rice as a main substrate.

**Though it isn't only children and the GF that need worry.** One Consumer Reports analysis conducted by two MD's from the University of Rochester and John Hopkins concluded ""Our resulting analysis of 3,633 study participants found that on average, people who reported eating one rice food item had total urinary arsenic levels 44 percent greater than those who had not, and people who reported consuming two or more rice products had levels 70 percent higher than those who had no rice."" \[[5](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/11/arsenic-in-your-food/index.htm)\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Now for the good part! *What the hell do you eat?!*

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The levels of contamination vary primarily by **where the rice was grown** and **what type of rice** it is.

**BIGGEST OFFENDERS (Rice to avoid)** \[[6](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/how-much-arsenic-is-in-your-rice/index.htm)\]**:**

* Rices grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas (or US in general)
* ""Brown rice has 80 percent more inorganic arsenic on average than white rice of the same type""

**BETTER RICES (Opt for these if eating rice)** \[[7](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/how-much-arsenic-is-in-your-rice/index.htm)\]:

* White basmati rice from California, India, and Pakistan, and sushi rice from the U.S.
* Brown basmati from California, India, or Pakistan
* Himalayan basmati

**GRAINS LOWER IN ARSENIC (Rice alternatives):** ""The gluten-free grains amaranth, buckwheat, millet, and polenta or grits had negligible levels of inorganic arsenic. Bulgur, barley, and farro, which contain gluten, also have very little arsenic. Quinoa (also gluten-free), had average inorganic arsenic levels comparable to those of other alternative grains. But some samples had quite a bit more."" \[[8](https://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/01/how-much-arsenic-is-in-your-rice/index.htm)\]

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**TLDR/SUMMARY:** Rice and rice-based products pose a unique risk to human health and well-being via contamination with inorganic arsenic (a group 1 carcinogen). These are not negligible amounts as some would have you believe either. At-risk groups include infants and children consuming rice-based cereals and products, those who buy consumer gluten-free products, and anyone consuming rice on a regular or frequent basis.

The best way to limit exposure is to avoid offending rices, limit rice intake in general, and vary your whole grains and carbohydrates. If you do choose to eat rice, the better rices are white basmati rice sourced from California, India, Pakistan, and the Himalayas. Brown is shown to have higher levels than white due to the hull of grain being intact, but there is talk that the benefits of the whole grain may outweigh the higher contaminant levels. Rices you want to steer clear of are grown in Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas, and the US (excluding California). Along with heavy consumption of the aforementioned rice-based products listed above.

You see videos of some bodybuilders (who aren't that big) consuming like whole chickens for meals or simply way more than 25 grams of protein....

I'm obviously nowhere close to pro bodybuilding level but I can't imagine Ronnie Coleman and jay cutler could only utilize 200g protein a day, I imagine they needed like 500g or some ridiculous number

So as we are becoming increasingly aware, a lot of standards for health both physically and mentally are outdated and have many times been disproportionately established by using primarily male subjects.

We all know drinking alcohol isn’t great, and there are many things to say about that, but I just want to discuss this one specific point.

I find it very funny that the generalized standard for safe consumption of alcohol in a week is a maximum of 14 Standard drinks for men, but only 7 standard drinks for women (as I said - there are many points of contention with this issue, so maybe you believe the ideal for everyone is zero drinks, maybe you think three, that’s not the point here.)

It seems so generalized that a woman would be considered as being doubly affected by the negative effects of alcohol versus a man, and I’m so curious about how this was established.

Even just considering vitamins and supplements - women are usually fractionally different in the DV they require versus men - so how could the effects of alcohol be so drastically different?

Now we all hear of the calories in/calories out theory and what matters is the balance of this equation to decide the weight gain/loss.

For example, a study found that eating before bedtime has increased the weight gain twice as much when controlling for total calories [(source)](https://www.northwestern.edu/newscenter/stories/2009/09/turek.html). However, this study was done on mice and not humans and doesn't apply to trained individuals as well.

So what are your thoughts about this?

1642345849,I got a free waffle at Waffle House this morning.,"Before I went to Waffle House this morning I browsed their website at home on my phone to see what my best meal option would be. I wanted something deliciously satisfying and... I wanted two waffles.

They didn't have the prices on their site, though, and the pictures of the menus didn't either so I was just going to have to go in on a hunch that an extra waffle would cost me maybe a couple extra bucks.

Once I got there I looked on the menu trying to locate which meal I was going to get: the All Star Special, eggs over hard, hash browns with gravy on top, toast, sausage patties and a waffle. Would you believe a waffle a la carte is four bucks? Oh well. I'll just have to suck it up and get the single waffle with my meal so I placed the order.

Moments later over my shoulder I hear another waitress addressing someone asking, ""Do you want this waffle, sir? . . . Sir?"" I glance over and she's holding the plate my direction and looking at me! ""Sure!"" I thanked her, she sets the plate in front of me and I smile at the bonus waffle sitting in front of me!

My waitress appears again about a minute later looking frustrated or confused or concerned and asks me, ""Do you still want the waffle that comes with your meal?"" And I quickly respond, ""Yes, of course."" Then the other waitress laughs and says, ""That was your free waffle."" I laughed and said I know and continued eating my bonus waffle.

Some food products don't appear to correctly calculate nutrition. For example, a large size container of Marie Callender's Chicken Pot Pie has 2 servings, with 440 calories per serving. Total with 440 \* 2 equals 880 for the container.   
The next column over has nutrition per container. It reads 930 calories per container.  
Now I'm not a mathematical wiz, but this certainly isn't rocket science.   
How is the total per each container 50 calories more than when calculating total servings? Does the pot pie tear open the fabric of spacetime within my stomach and inject an extra 50 calories?

1642976088,Why isn't the thermal effect of food 13% ?,"Hello everyone.

I've red that, for simplification, we consider TEF (also called DIT) to be 10-20% of BMR.

Knowing that:
TEF Carbohydrates - 5-15% of the energy consumed
TEF Proteins - 20-30%
TEF Fats - 5-15%

And that:
It's recommended for between 10-35% (x̄: 22,5) of our meal to be proteins, 45-65 (x̄: 55) of carbohydrates, and 20-35 (x̄: 27,5) of fat.

Assuming also, since it is nutrition, that you want to (slightly, 7-8 calories per hour so 168-192/day) improve your RMR; you'd chose to consume more carbohydrates in order to burn them during any kind of anaerobic exercise (and that you do not add any MCT):
12,5% of the meal would be proteins, 60% would be carbohydrates, 27,5% would be lipids.

[((5+15)/2+(20+30)/2)/2/100*40]+[(5+15)/2/100*60]=13%

# just for explaination of the first half, it's basically just proteins and lipids added together so I can divide by 40 instead of dividing separately by 27,5% and 12,5%

So you'd end up with 13% of TEF, added to your BMR,  your non-exercise activity thermogenesis, and eventually your exercises and excess post-energy oxygen consumption.

I know when we use equations to calculate TDEE, we're simplifying everything and shouldn't expect the most accurate results, but 10-20% is just a big range of possibilities so I'm trying to reduce it to a simpler value.

So if I'm not mistaken, it'd be TEF = TDEE - (NEAT + EPOC + Ex) - [BMR / 100 * (100 - 13)]

If any of you knows about this subject, may you please tell me if that's a good idea for me to just directly consider TEF to be 13%?

1. Multi Collagen Protein Powder Pure - Ancient Nutrition 
2. Collagen Peptide - Vital Nutrition

The biggest difference I can see is that Vital Nutrition has 1 source of Collagen (Bovine) and an Amino Acid Blend, while Ancient Nutrition has 4 sources of Collagen (Bovine, Chicken, Egg, Fish) and no Amino Acid blend.

I'd love any suggestions between the 2, but I'm mostly wondering whether I should be placing more emphasis on the additional types of Collagen or the Amino Acid blend. I'm not quite sure about whether either is very important tbh.

I just had a discussion about what the correct time is (not regarding daytime) to take your vitamin supplements.

Especially regarding fat-soluble vitamins, I always heard it's important to take them after a meal with some fats in it so they are transported properly to the destinations they have to reach.

Is it actually the fats in your stomach at that point of time when you take the vitamins that counts? Or does the bloodfats at the time you take them count?

As an example: I just ate my breakfast, bacon and whatnot. Is it recommended to take the supps right after the breakfast? Or wait a little?

Or is it actually better if you wait some time so your bloodfats are higher?

I can't really find anything online.

My local grocery stores in germany usually only have hulled golden millet and online I can find whole fingermillet (red ragi), whole red millet (braunhirse in german), hulled sorghum and some other varieties, kodo, foxtail, little, proso, which all look hulled too but its not stated.

It is hard to find information about how to prepare them, golden millet and sorghum can easily be cooked, fingermillet is apparently consumed raw more as a supplement or as flour and doesnt get soft when cooked so its not suited for cooking. You cannot hull this variant either. I wonder if its really unedible or just unpleasant?

Is it thats the same with sorghum and golden millet and thats why i only find them hulled? I found red sorghum in a US online store and I think the red part is a hull so it wouldnt be hulled. It seems fingermillet is only used as flour either, so i suppose its like with the red one, but i dont know. It would make sense if they all are just suitable for cooking hulled, since i was surprised that you can cook some and not others if they are of the same species basically. Would it have benefits to eat the unhulled flour instead of the hulled? Does unhulled mean the same as whole and unhulled are not whole anymore (main question)?",True,1,1.0,1,mushykindofbrick,False,False,nutrition

1643693584,Starch in milk?," Typically, when you look at the carbohydrate content of milk, you will see that it is something like 10g of carbohydrates and 10g sugar, meaning that all the carbohydrates in the milk are sugar. I have, however, encountered milk that seems to have starch in the carbohydrate content. For example, it will look something like this: 12g of carbohydrates, 11g sugar, and then 0 fiber or sugar alcohol, which only leaves the remaining possible carbohydrate to be starch, meaning this milk has 1g of starch in it.

When I looked up on Google whether milk has naturally occurring starch, It seems that it actually does not. So now I'm thinking, did they add starch to this milk? When I look at the ingredients of the milk, there is no listed added starch, it simply says ""Grass Fed Whole Milk, Vitamin D3."" How is this possible?

Here is a link to the type of milk I am talking about:

This came up because I was comparing the different protein products from Garden of Life and noticed that their %DV varies between their different products.

*Documentaire de Patrizia Marani (France/Italie, 2020, 1h19mn)*

Les cas d’intolérance au gluten explosent et les maladies coeliaques sont quatre fois plus élevées que dans les années 1950. Cette ambitieuse enquête révèle les dommages causés par la dérégulation de notre économie sur le blé, notre aliment de base.

Magique, le gluten apporte gonflant et liant aux préparations culinaires. En revanche, il est indigeste. Mais s’il ne fait qu’alourdir l’estomac d’une personne en bonne santé, il provoque chez les individus cœliaques ou sensibles une réaction immunitaire dévastatrice. En 2018, le marché mondial des produits sans gluten pesait 15 milliards d'euros. Il devrait plus que doubler d'ici à 2027. La diabolisation de cette protéine qui se forme en mélangeant l'eau à la farine ne constitue-t-elle qu’un argument marketing ? Ou le blé s’est-il mué en poison ? Comment cette céréale faite pour mûrir au soleil peut-elle prospérer dans des pays froids comme l’Ukraine ou le Canada ? Les cas de maladies cœliaques, quatre fois plus élevés que dans les années 1950, et de sensibilité au gluten ont explosé, avec une vitesse excluant une mutation génétique et accusant notre environnement.

**Géopolitique du blé**

Jadis élancés, les blés ont rapetissé. Pourquoi ? Parce que les variétés naines s’accordaient mieux avec les engrais à base de nitrates et de phosphates, matières à explosifs dont il fallait écouler les stocks accumulés durant la Seconde Guerre mondiale… Ces ""petits blés"" contiennent moins de gluten mais dotent celui-ci d'une élasticité renforcée que nous tolérons moins bien. Ce gluten tenace, niché dans de nombreux produits transformés, n'explique pourtant pas à lui seul l'épidémie actuelle. Les résidus grandissants de glyphosate, un herbicide, dans les aliments à base de céréales ont une part écrasante de responsabilité.

Le constat dressé par cette enquête, multipliant les éclairages de chercheurs, économistes, juristes, fermiers ou militants, laisse pantois : mainmise des multinationales sur les réglementations, modèle industriel favorisant les grands céréaliers, interdépendance des pays entravant la régulation… Contrainte d’importer une partie de son blé, l’Italie, qui interdit la dessication (prisé dans les pays froids, le procédé consiste à vaporiser l’herbicide juste avant la moisson pour faire mûrir les plantes artificiellement), a tenté d’indiquer sur les paquets de pâtes la provenance des grains. Le Canada a aussitôt déposé un recours au tribunal de l’OMC.

Now I know it's not easy to say since everyone are different but I was thinking about a general meal routine that includes everything you need to be healthy, so lets assume someone woke up this morning and haven't had anything to eat yet.

How would his breakfast look like? What will he snack throughout the day (if any) how would his lunch and dinner look like?

Also portion sizes differ since obviously some people need more calories than others so lets put that aside and only talk about what food goes on the plate.

This person is healthy and doesn't have any dietry restrictions so he can eat meat no food alergies and isn't diabtic, he doesn't work out heavily so he doesn't need to build muscles.",True,1,1.0,1,itaicool,False,False,nutrition

No.  I don't.  And you don't need free range, grass fed and finished, all organic organ meat either.  Plenty of people live perfectly healthy lives with no avocado, or almonds, or salmon, or kiwis, or whatever your ""necessary"" food is.  Plenty.  No one NEEDS to eat anything.

All the tracking apps sucked, on top of the fact that I knew that a spreadsheet would be better for this kinda stuff anyway. I looked around, but nothing was really that good. So I made my own. Now, this was made by me for me, so maybe it won't work for you. For example, I don't have a very varied diet, and have only really eaten like 10 meals my whole life, so I don't gotta keep a track of that many strings. I have about 70 items in total and basically never have to consult the list.

One of the most important thing for me when making this was to have it so that I only had to type into a single cell. Surprisingly, this was a bitch and a half to achieve as Excel really doesn't want to do calculations like this. In the end, I found a way that turned a single cell with multiple entries into multiple cells with single entries, which is where the calculation is done. The only way to achieve this (afaik) was to have a specific number of characters representing the amount and type of food.

One of the best things about this is that it's self correcting. That is, if you discover that you had the wrong calories or protein listed for a given item, then changing it will retroactively fix it for any day that you ate it previously. And if you haven't made an entry for an item, you can still type it in for that day, and then just add the nutrients whenever you want.

Note: I use Excel, not Google sheets. I have a home server so I can open it anywhere. You can use Google sheets, but you have to add a ' at the start because Google sheets sucks. It also lags.",True,1,1.0,1,Yoyomaster3,False,False,nutrition

If it is not smoked, what if ingested or applied on your skin, does THC have any negative effects in regards to gaining the most?

# United States Dietary Trends Since 1800: Lack of Association Between Saturated Fatty Acid Consumption and Non-communicable Diseases


We reviewed data on the American diet from 1800 to 2019.

**Methods:**  We examined food availability and estimated consumption data from 1800 to 2019 using historical sources from the federal government and additional public data sources.

**Results:**  Processed and ultra-processed foods increased from &lt;5 to &gt;60% of foods. Large increases occurred for sugar, white and whole wheat flour, rice, poultry, eggs, vegetable oils, dairy products, and fresh vegetables. Saturated fats from animal sources declined while polyunsaturated fats from vegetable oils rose. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) rose over the twentieth century in parallel with increased consumption of processed foods, including sugar, refined flour and rice, and vegetable oils. Saturated fats from animal sources were inversely correlated with the prevalence of NCDs.

**Conclusions:**  As observed from the food availability data, processed and ultra-processed foods dramatically increased over the past two centuries, especially sugar, white flour, white rice, vegetable oils, and ready-to-eat meals. These changes paralleled the rising incidence of NCDs, while animal fat consumption was inversely correlated.",True,1,1.0,4,rugbyvolcano,False,False,nutrition

Is there a link between Professor Lustig's research and the blue zone longevity and healthfulness in the simplest of ways do you think possibly? There are numerous podcasts and YouTube videos of his lectures but the fundamental famous one that I saw was here and as you can see it's got 16,790,663 views. There are updated podcasts and other free YouTube resources if you look.

They are notorious for have a very high amount of protein and low amount of sugar yet still tasting good compared to many other high protein beverages. The FairLife drinks are also usually only 14oz/serving, so the volume isn't very large either. Is this something to do with the processing? I've never come across nutrition facts like these.
